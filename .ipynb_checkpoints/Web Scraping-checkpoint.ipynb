      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  4 Hours before takeoff we received a Mail stating a cryptic message that there are disruptions to be expected as there is a limit on how many planes can leave at the same time. So did the capacity of the Heathrow Airport really hit British Airways by surprise, 4h before departure? Anyhow - we took the one hour delay so what - but then we have been forced to check in our Hand luggage. I travel only with hand luggage to avoid waiting for the ultra slow processing of the checked in luggage. Overall 2h later at home than planed, with really no reason, just due to incompetent people. Service level far worse then Ryanair and triple the price. Really never again. Thanks for nothing.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  I recently had a delay on British Airways from BRU to LHR that was due to staff shortages. They announced that there was a 2 hour holding delay but they would board us immediately in hopes of clearing the gate and leaving early. We had to wait the full 2 hours inside the airplane. The plane was old, dirty, had no power at the seats. The staff provided a small bag of pretzels and 250ml of water to the passengers for 2 hour delay and 2 hour flight. There were no options to purchase food or drink. There were no entertainment options available. I am a OneWorld emerald elite member but they do not upgrade members based on status. First class lounges at Heathrow are overcrowded, understaffed and poorly equipped. The help desk is completely unhelpful when an error arises with delays and cancellations - even when having the top status. The Avios points system has been devalued to near worthlessness and requires fees to book reward that nearly equal the price of the revenue ticket. British has lost its way in recent years and has a moved from a world-class airline to a budget airline with much worse service and timeliness than Ryanair or EasyJet.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  5 days before the flight, we were advised by BA that it had been cancelled and asked us to rebook. There were flights 1 hour before and 1 hour after our original flight but they made us take one 3 hours earlier. Our original ticket (and the return flight a week later) included a checked bag. When we arrive at Heathrow to check in we are told our ticket doesn't included a bag and we will have to pay 75 pounds each to take them. We explained that the original ticket had the bags and when they checked the system they confirmed that it did- but not this one! They would make no effort to sort it out and just told us to pay up or they would remove us from the flight. So we had no choice but to pay up, thinking it should be pretty easy to get a refund. 15 months and 10 emails later we have still not seen a penny. Every time I ask where my refund is and state how long we have been waiting I get an inane email saying some departments take longer than others to respond!  Absolutely hopeless airline to stuff up the booking in the first place and even worse customer service to not even attempt to solve the problem at check in even when they could see the mistake THEY had made in their system, compounded by being be unable to investigate a very simple claim, and refund me 150 pounds in 15 months.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  Booked a flight from Bucharest to Manchester with a 2h 45’ layover at Heathrow. Flight was delayed from Bucharest because of ATC strike. Arrived at Heathrow 40 minutes later than scheduled and still had enough time to catch my connecting flight. Unfortunately we were stranded in the plane and waited a very long time to disembark the plane due to lack of staff or slot shortage (it’s a common problem with BA at Heathrow). I missed my connecting flight because of their delays and they told me I had to wait all night in a freezing airport for the first flight the next day. There was just a shameful 10£ food voucher which is a joke considering the ridiculous prices at LHR. No accommodation offered and had to sleep in a very cold airport. I asked for compensation and they sent me a long text with the same lame excuses that they are sorry, but they will not compensate anything.  I can’t imagine a worst airline than BA regarding customer care. It is not about money here but rather than the way they treat customers. It is the last time in my lifetime that I will be flying this joke of an airline.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  Booked online months ago and the only hitch was replacement aircraft meaning chosen seats were different. I was informed of this prior to departure so could amend. Bag drop at MAN T3 wasn't smooth but I suspect that was MAN fault. Shuttle boarding was slow and delayed meaning a rush at LHR T5. The flight to CPT was full but we left more or less on time. The cabin was clean and PE was what we expected, sufficient leg and arm room plus a few little perks with drinks. Only complaint is the seats actually recline too far. Staff were very good during the first few hours of service, especially George. Food was quite tasty but one option wasn't loaded. Breakfast was also quite tasty and we landed on time. The fly in the ointment is both our cases arrived late on the carousel and only later did we notice both had been broken into, likely at CPT. All in all a pleasant surprise.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  As an infrequent flyer, British Airways was always my first choice. With some reassurance and comfort of service, quality, luggage allowance etc. In fact I’ve never flown with the budget airlines. My most recent flight has now changed my view and causes me to reflect on what am I actually getting for my money and is BA what they once were. While the flights were around an hour delayed both ways, the cabin and ground staff service were ok. It is the facilities (or lack of) that I am most disappointed by. The flight was Approx 4 and a half hours and the only thing offered was a half cup of water that was poured out and a bite sized banana slice of cake. In fact on my return journey I wasn’t even offered the water! To top it off BA no longer have a media screen from which you can select something to pass the time away. There wasn’t even the obligatory flight journey. The WiFi was poor. I couldn’t even access the shop. However, for a fee so much more was available. This explains BAs record profit of £1.52bn. So, the question is, what am I paying for? I will now for sure opt for the budget airlines. They are transparent with what they offer and what you have to pay for, which I can decide to choose or not. As BA now stands for Basic Airways I’ll go elsewhere and get basic for cheaper.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |   1. Ground crew in Heathrow left 60 passengers luggage. We had 3 bags. 2. The Heathrow ground crew left 1 of ours behind after the 1st two were received the next day. 3. The Heathrow ground crew lost our 3rd bag 4 times and we were on the phone with them for over 3 hrs over the course of the week! 4. Due to this, we had to spend $500 on health and beauty items for my wife on our cruise. 5. British Airways said they MIGHT reimburse after 3 months. 6. We had to spend $100 in cab fare to Barcelona because the Bacelona ground crew (Iberia) claimed they had delivered it to us. 7. Heathrow ground crew made us 15 minutes late arriving back into Heathrow after our cruise. We actually landed 10 minutes early, but those incompetent people still were not ready for us. 8. The Heathrow ground crew caused us to leave 45 minutes late even though ALL passengers were boarded and ready 15 minutes before the departure time. This will probably mean we will miss our connection in Anchorage. BA clearly does not care or know how to operate a ground base...shameful. BA is a joke and should be embarrassed they can't operate like a normal airline. They do not grasp the concept that even a small hiccup can cause mass ripples of chaos to other people.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Gibraltar on 24th October 2023. I shall start by reference to the booking process. I used the BA website to reserve the seat and food the website to be easy to use and clear in every aspect. The flight was due to depart from terminal 3 but the passengers were bussed for a good 15 minutes to a different part of the airport where the aircraft was on a stand. When boarding the flight the cabin-crew kept a very low profile and this was maintained during the entire flight. The captain made 3 brief announcements during the flight. There was no in-flight entertainment. The seats were clean and comfortable enough for a short flight. The lack of catering was overt. Other than a tiny bottle of water and an inedible “breakfast bar” one had to use an online system to order even a drink and of course pay for it too. The passengers next to me could not use the online system as it doe not seem to work and the cabin refused to sell them a coffee because of this fault. Moreover, the USB charge points did not work either. Given the early hour of the flight it is a poor show that there are not even for sale items available from a trolley service. The system BA have in place is not good enough. The flight arrived on-time. The disembarkation was inefficient though and poorly managed and the crew were not to be seen. The crew were wearing the new BA uniform and it seems to reflect a downward trend of the airline. To be candid, there was any difference between this BA service and that of so-called “budget” rivals. On this route BA have a monopoly and so I did not have an option to use the services of a different company.\n",

      "Review: Not Verified |  Absolutely the worst experience ever.  Flew into Heathrow, no problem. Waited for 5 hours, three extra hours, for our connection to Porto then the cancelled the flight. Scrambled for a hotel and a new flight the next day. They routed us through Madrid the next morning. That flight was 1.5 hours late so we missed our connection to Porto. Because we missed the connection (their fault), they cancelled our return flights. After two hours on the phone with customer service from the Madrid airport, they booked us a new return flight, then they made is pay $ 1300 to fly from Madrid to Porto. Then, for no reason they cancelled our return flight again! After hours, and hours and hours with customer service, we finally got a return flight five days after our original return flight. Meanwhile, they lost my wife's luggage. We finally got 15 DAYS after they lost it. Return flight? More problems with our reservations. At no point was British Airways helpful. They left the onus on us to fix their mistakes at every turn. They completely ruined a three week vacation and they don't care. They wouldn't even let us speak to a supervisor or manager. Awful, bordering on passenger abuse.\n",

For more than half of the flight a child was watching an iPad very loud with no phones plugged in - it was three rows in front of me and disrupted my flight as I could hear it above my headphones. Staff thought this was fine and refused to tell the mom to turn it down. Why is this acceptable on a flight especially in business class? Has this airline turned into a zoo? Are staff given no training in customer service? Why is a child allowed to disrupt other passengers? When I told the staff she just laughed at me. BA customer service is a disgrace. I've not even mentioned the food but it was bad, really bad.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |   The flight departed over an hour late due to a late inbound plane. The plane was very full, and half of the economy class passengers were forced to check in their larger cabin baggage at the gate when boarding, making a complete mockery of the hand luggage allowance advertised. Lots of passengers on board were stressed out about missing onwards connections due to the delays (and some did miss them as their next gates had closed by the time we disembarked at Heathrow). Onboard service was ok but minimal  - BA gave up being a full-service airline some time ago. More concerning is that trying to get hold of customers services to make changes to bookings and deal with problems was non-existent. The airline seems to make it deliberately hard for its customers to contact it.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |   Our BA flight from Porto to London Heathrow T5 was operated by Finnair using a Finnair plane and crew. This had been advised by BA shortly after booking, with the option to change flights if we preferred. Although the business class cabin was of a similar layout to BA Club Europe, i.e. with the middle seat kept free, my wife and I felt the seats were more comfortable and the legroom slightly better. Service was good on board and the meal was very tasty (we chose the beef cheeks). All was good until we landed at Heathrow! Although we passed through passport control without delay, once we were at the designated baggage reclaim, we just waited and waited! After an hour and ten minutes I went to the BA baggage counter to ask what was going on. They seemed unaware of an issue, but said they would find out! Over the next hour or so various other passengers also requested information and despite various announcements and a list of different excuses it was almost 2½ hours before the bags finally arrived. Frustrating to say the least. I subsequently complained to BA, but after 4 weeks there has been no explanation just the automated message from customer services ‘we are experiencing exceptionally high volumes’. This response says a lot!\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified | The customer services (call centres etc) are atrocious and sometimes callous. They just don’t care. Long waits to speak to anybody, who then have no power to actually solve anything, and the calls just cut halfway without resolution anyway. If the flights are cancelled (as were my original ones) you’re really left on your own and nobody cares. The onboard services are so-so but for short haul it’s now “semi-low cost” which is confusing as you never know what to expect. This time we were given a bottle of water and a (very) small snack, whilst anything else had to be paid for. And yet on some other flights apparently you have to pre-order any additional food. It’s confusing, which makes it not dependable. Cabin baggage is in theory generous compared to competitors in economy but then they asked more than half the passengers on this flight to check in the cabin baggage at the gate due to lack of space in the overhead cabins, leading to long boarding delays. Their whole offering hasn’t been thought through very well . The USB power supply did not work throughout the flight (contrary to the announcement that the power be available after the seatbelt sight was turned off ) so it was pointless providing the sockets in the first place. Not my first choice airline on this route and am just trying to use up most of my Avios points before I totally abandon them. I fail to see how it is deemed a 4 star airline.\n",

      "Review: Not Verified |  Flew with BA to Punta Cana. Took the trouble to reserve seats for both outbound and inbound flights. On boarding at Gatwick, realised we had been moved to much less good seats with other people sitting in the seats we had spent a lot of money reserving. Apparently there has been a change of aircraft and a number of passengers had been automatically reallocated seats for no particular reason. The crew said there was nothing they could do (although of course they could just have swapped us with the couple using our seats). We were told to claim a refund on return home. We did this via a complaint form Ns BA offered us £100 in vouchers. We didn't accept this as it was less than the cost of the seats and also naturally we wanted our money back. We eventually got it but not without a fight. Very second rate shoddy airline.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |   They downgraded me from business to premium economy. They took three months to get back to me and offered me 200 pounds or 400 AUD. The difference between business class and premium economy (which I never fly) is $3000 AUD and the difference between economy and business is $6500 AUD. They owe me at least 1500 pounds and to be very fair 3250 pounds. The downgrade was insulting and incredibly painful as I had a recent cancer operation and have a back injury which I have pointed out to them - I need to lie down. The wait for them to get around to me has been numbing. The insult of their offer has been the slap in the face to continue my degradation. The people I have dealt with at the airport have been down to earth, honest hard working people. The actual staff on the plane were warm and friendly - and helpful. The systems under which BA operates are some sort of medieval torture.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |   The already delayed aircraft landed and apart from the small BA logo on the rear of the fuselage, there was no indication as to whom the carrier really was. Boarding turned into a farce with passenger groups being told to wait in one queue in order to board, only to be informed we were on the wrong place and our boarding wasn't allowed yet. The interior cabin was reminiscent of a BA cabin from twenty years earlier except the tight legroom and uncomfortable seating which made a budget airline feel luxurious. The crew were not BA but from an unknown charter company. Service was slow, and as usual, choices of food to purchase ran out before they'd reached row 24. I requested a cup of tea which never appeared. Thank goodness for my airport purchased water and the tiny offering of pretzels. The over officious senior flight attendant, who'd been facilitating in 'Club Europe' appeared in economy and immediately slammed down the armrests (whilst still in mid flight) making an already uncomfortable journey feel worse. \"Cattle class\" was definitely that! To say I was happy to land and disembark was an understatement. Never again BA, never again!\n",

This time, a 45 min late departure, which seems the norm for BA, and no information from the rude and clueless boarding gate staff. The Club lounge was overcrowded, dirty and grubby and cleaning staff could not cope. How many more cutbacks is BA going to apply before they become truly low cost. As a 35 year veteran user of BA, while people complained of Alex Cruz cutting costs, the past 3 years has seen them decline very quickly under their latest CEO. One reads the occasional article about BA improving things, but I have yet to see anything substantive. There seem to be few British staff left amongst the cabin crew, so maybe time for a name change and give the flag carrier status to a proper low-cost - and sadly the staff service has declined year on year. Onboard, the catering remains poor and surprised that Do&Co can produce such rubbish meals when I have sampled their Turkish Airlines equivalent in August that was superb - guessing BA are too tight with their budget. Onboard WiFi service is a joke and should be avoided.\n",

The funny thing is that I had another business trip in spring 2023, also with BA to Amsterdam. When I arrived to the Airport that time - I was told I don't have a seat. I was put on the next flight in several hours, which should have get me to the business meeting late, but still not too much. A lot of stress.

Without explanation, told everyone to go to a gate. After another hour or so they made us re enter the UK via passport control, a further 40 minute wait. By now the airport was closing and there was no sign of our bags or any help from BA. A passing Gatwick engineer finally helped us locate the bags. BA completely washed their hands of us and in contravention of CAA rules refused to find us accommodation. Many slept in a bus stop overnight. There were people with young children who couldn’t find somewhere to stay and yet BA had closed down and left. The following day the replacement flight was also late and due to an admin mistake had no catering or liquids for a 2 1/2 hr flight.

The outbound flight from Miami was delayed and we were further delayed when our gate was occupied when we arrived in Heathrow. The total delay was roughly an hour, but it was enough to make our connection a challenge, where we had 73 minutes between original arrival time until the departure time to Dublin. When we headed to our connection flight, we were stopped by security personnel at a checkpoint and told us that the gate to our connection flight had already closed. This was twenty minutes prior to departure time. They ushered us to customer service to be rebooked. Given the busy weekend of travel, we were rebooked on a flight at a different airport and were told that our cost to get there would be reimbursed. We then waited 3 hours for our luggage, and then took a cab to London's City Airport. The cab fare was roughly $500. When I filed a claim with British Airways, they refused the claim and told me that we had plenty of time to make our connecting flight and therefore they denied my claim to be reimbursed for the cab fare. This is after I explained that it was British Airways employees who ushered us to rebook the flight despite the 20 minute timeframe to make the connecting flight. The person who rebooked us, told us it was policy that they close the gate 20 minutes prior to departure. I will never fly this awful airline again.

As you can see from the picture they hardly were business class. All they did was block off the middle seat in the first few rows and called it business class. Horrible flight. In addition I had a really rude rude check in clerk basically yell at me when I excused myself and asked if she could give a little bit of priority to the many business class passengers who weren’t being served. Then we got to Heathrow and the real fun began. We had a 4 hour delay. They gave us about 5 different excuses for the delay. I had a few employees walk away while I was asking them questions. They were very rude. At one point there were no employees left. And from the announcements it seems virtually every BA flight was delayed. And there were no weather issues. There was no place to comfortably store items in business class. I’ve never experienced that before. Not even a cup holder for my bottle of water. The seat controls didn’t work well. You had to keep pushing the buttons to get them to do anything. The power outlet didn’t work. There was no internet the entire flight. The overhead luggage bin was too heavy.

It’s such a shame to have watched what used to be a good company fall down a cliff.

After engineers tried to fix it while we waited on the plane for over an hour we were finally told that we would have to be evacuated and rebooked for another flight but not to worry because a special crew was waiting for us on the ground to help us and set us up in a hotel except that there was no one to help us. In fact everyone refused to help us. It was Saturday almost 8pm and they just wanted to go home. Anyone with a connecting flight couldn't rebook on the application because the app wouldn't disassociate our first flight with the connecting one in London and the staff saw this but still refused to help us. They gave us a phone number but there was only a message that said just to use the app. Finally I got someone on the phone who rebooked us for the next day. Now it's 10:30pm and I have to find a hotel room because the airline refused also to help us with that. So i had 2 choices either sleep in the airport or pay over 700GBP for a room. I don't have the money to pay for this but after a 10 hour flight, 8 hours of jet lag and the insane stress after the fact that no one from British Airways would help us I took the room. Of course I claimed reimbursement but that was over 3 weeks ago and I haven't heard anything since so I have no idea when or how much I'll be reimbursed, even though I'm not claiming any emotional compensation from the horrible situation they put me through due to their total indifference. It's financially difficult for me right now because the money I had to put out is equal to half my salary and of course it's impossible to reach them by phone.

They did manage to get me another flight the following evening with Lufthansa to Italy via Frankfurt. However, I did miss the first part of my trip having arrived a day and a half later than I was supposed to. Upon moving the flights I did ask the BA staff whether my flights back are still valid and that everything is in order, which they assured me is correct. I have to fly back to South Africa on 18 September and upon checking my booking information I noticed on my BA account that my first flight (Milan to London) is just missing from my booking. My connecting from London to Johannesburg is still there. After spending the entire morning on the customer helpline two different operators picked up and in both instances, the moment I proceed to give my booking reference number, my call gets dropped. Currently it seems like I will be arriving at the airport again on Monday without a flight.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  My daughter and I were denied boarding on our business class flight from Madrid to Heathrow in March 25, 2023, the first leg on our return flight to Victoria, Canada. No reason was given for the denied boarding by the check in staff at the British Airways counter in Madrid, who said they were only agents and told us to call British Airways. We were three hours early for the flight and had valid passports. After many tries we finally reached British Airways by phone, but we were told to call Expedia which had booked the flights. Expedia confirmed that we had been bumped from the flight, with no explanation as to why. Expedia then began a long process of finding alternative flights. Over the next 24 hours we had numerous calls with both Expedia and British Airways. Incredibly, the next available flights were 9 days later on April 3. This was almost unbelievable, but after many many tries it was the best we could do. Even though these were Business Class tickets. Part of the problem was that apparently rules did not allow any changes to routing for any segment of the flight. This nine day delay was a major problem for us. I had to miss work and my daughter was missing school. Further, we received no compensation from British Airways, no penalty fee, and not any reimbursement of our expenses for staying the nine extra days. After our return I began the British Airways online complaint process, and submitted all supporting documents. I received an email reply and a case reference number. And then nothing. I sent numerous follow up emails, and received no replies. It is now months later, and still I have not heard from British Airways. This is shocking, and definitely the worst airline service I have received for my thousands of flights over many decades. I am a very patient person and this is the first time I have commented on this type of forum. I think the public should be made aware of extremely poor customer service at British Airways.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways has a total lack of respect for its customers. I was booked to fly from Frankfurt Main to London City Airport, and just a couple of hours before the scheduled departure the flight was suddenly cancelled by BA without explanation, when I was already at the airport. The worst thing was the utter callousness that staff showed towards customers. The ground staff’s attitude was that they are merely third party agents, not BA employees, and therefore they quickly washed their hands of us all, telling us we had to contact BA directly via phone if we wanted help. They couldn’t even provide us a phone number, telling us to look it up on ba.com ! So BA abandoned its passengers. They did tell us that the BA departure to Heathrow had also been cancelled, meaning there would be no further BA flight from Frankfurt to London that day (although other airlines were still operating the route- but BA refused to rebook us on them). The reason given for both cancellations was “technical reasons”. No assistance or information was provided on our rights due to cancellation, nor any information on help regarding food/ accommodation help etc. Their attitude was literally that the cancellation had nothing to do with them and it was our problem, not theirs. I received an email an hour later notifying me that I had been automatically rebooked on an alternative flight 24 hours later, which wasn’t acceptable as I had to get back to London that night. I rang BA’s call centre and again, they showed a high degree of callousness. 95% of the half-hour call was spent with me waiting on hold, with the phone just cutting off after half an hour, and no meaningful information given to me by that point. There was no attempt by the call operator to call me back when the line cut (and I had a solid phone signal and wifi as I was still standing in Terminal 2 of Frankfurt Main airport), even though my phone number is listed in my booking contact details. They just don’t care. In the end I had to arrange my own return to London by taking a coach to Hanh airport which was 112km away , waiting there for 5 hours and then booking an expensive last minute ticket with Ryanair to Stansted. At least that flight operated on time and got me back to London! BA is worse than a low cost carrier now.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  Flying A380 business class should be a pleasure but BA has made it a disaster with the worst seating and configuration imaginable. How could any sane person could jam so many seats into a limited space and expect passengers to be happy. Seats are narrower than economy on some airlines and you must face another person until a plastic screen is raised. The Tv screens are the size of a medium sized tablet and the controls are behind your head in a sitting position. There is no where to put anything except one small pull out draw at ground level that can not be reached when seated nor accessed when sleeping . The window seats and middle seats are accessed by having to jump over a passenger on an aisle seat and the seats are so low that they are hard for elderly to get out of. The whole business class set up is a sick joke. Eating is difficult because the seat is not close enough to the table and the tables are so flimsy that drinks can fall off. Are there any redeeming features - the answer is no. If you like a little comfort avoid BA like the plague.\n",

After enquiring at LAX check in, the agent said sorry, nothing we can do. Onboard the flight the attendants seemed to try and finish the meal service at a racing speed, with meals trays passed out with no proper questions about choice. Then back and clearing trays and they disappeared to rest in the kitchen for hours after that. No water runs, if you need anything do not bother with the call bell, as they simply ignore it. I used to like travelling British Airways 10-15 years ago, but the bean counters have been in and lowered it close to a lowcost carrier. I guess staff are badly paid from their terrible attitude and service.

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  I flew London to Malaga on 27 August in Club Europe. We stood around at Gate B45 in Terminal 5 for over an hour, with staff giving very different reasons for the delay, late inbound aircraft etc - but the plane we boarded had been sitting there for more than an hour! After boarding, the captain stated that because they had changed planes there would be no meals served. This is Club Europe, and we received one small packet of crisps throughout the flight. No effort to apologise. We smelt the hot meal for pilots being heated and then saw it being served to them on a Club Europe meal tray. Cabin crew also had warmed pastries ( and were very quick to use air freshener in the front galley!) while customers received zilch. BA sent an email the following morning to say sorry - nothing else. What a complete and utter rip off by an airline that is already cutting back on so many things. I paid a full Business class fare, did not receive any part of the onboard meal service and they expect an email to be sufficient. Avoid BA if you have any other option nowadays, they are the worst in Europe.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  I arrived at the airport about 2.5 hours before takeoff to have more than about time to get checked in, go through security, etc. All that went without any issues. Being that I was relatively early at the gate, I was one of the first passengers there. After some time boarding had opened. First the business class got called up, then families with children and disabled people. A couple minutes into the boarding they started to call up people, one by one, by name. Then there was an announcement: they won’t let anyone in anymore. Me and about fifty other people were still standing at the gate not being let in. The reason, they said, was that the plane was short staffed (Later I discovered, speaking to a manager, that not only the flight was short staffed but also it was overbooked). After the announcement people were getting angry because they wouldn’t be let in anymore. Nothing changed and everyone was sent away. I had a connecting flight later that day that I was going to miss because I was not let on the plane. First I tried to get my luggage back which I didn’t receive immediately but got a hold of later on thanks to the airport personnel. Then, just like everyone who was going to fly with the same plane, I wanted to talk to someone from British Airways. Since they don’t have a service center at Frankfurt Airport everyone went to the check-in counters where we received food vouchers but not a single person was either able to rebook my or anyone’s flight nor get anyone refunded. All the staff said was that we were going to receive an email in a couple hours with options to rebook the flight or get a refund. I waited four hours for the email at the airport that did not come until today. Trying to call the airline did not help either because they did not answer the phone or hung up in the middle of the conversation. After the four hours of waiting for the email me and some other people from the same flight went back to the check-in counter to get a confirmation from them that I will receive a refund. Being that there was a new shift the personell did not know what had happened. When they scanned my passport an looked at the flight they found out that the system was dying that it was my fault I could not attend the flight. It looked like I had missed it. For everyone standing there with me it was exactly the same. But the people at the counter said they could not do anything about it. Later on we were able to speak to the manager after many phone calls he said they were going to take care of it. We are supposed to get an email at some point in the future. I was not able to get a written confirmation that I will get refunded even after several times asking for it. I already flew a lot of times in my life but never ever has such a thing a happened to me. Not only that me and so many other people were not let into the plane but also the customer service being so horrible that they were not able to rebook or confirm a refund in any way. In the end the only option for me to get to my destination would have been to book a last minute flight for a lot of money which I would not know if I ever got it backed.\n",

British Airways Business Class seats for the Club Europe product are terrible - exactly the same as Economy with the middle seat left vacant. You don't even get extra pitch.

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified | Terrible Experience with British Airways. I booked a flight with BA to travel from Gibraltar to London Heathrow on May 10, 2023. My flight was scheduled to leave at 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon. I had originally planned on leaving my luggage at Heathrow upon arrival and travelling to visit and overnight at my cousin's place. En route to GIB airport a few hours prior to departure, I checked my flight details and found out that my flight had been cancelled. I had a connecting flight booked with Westjet from London Heathrow to Vancouver the following day and I had to make that flight, so it was imperative that I got to London. I checked the BA website and couldn't find any other flights with them that would work, so unfortunately I made the mistake of requesting a refund. I managed to find a flight out of Malaga that got me into London just after 10:00 p.m. so I booked that and then called British Airways as I wanted to discuss compensation. That's when they advised me that because I had requested a refund (they used the phrase \"abandoned\" travel with them), they were not prepared to do anything for me. Apparently, I should have called them first, and then they would have made the arrangements. Of course they don't explain that on their website - they just ask if you want a refund and then proceed. And even when I plead my case with the agent at Malaga airport and then followed up with Customer Relations several times via email, they flat out refused to budge. I had used a travel voucher to cover the cost of my flight and had used Avios to cover the cost of my checked baggage, so in other words no out of pocket costs for the trip. Once this incident happened, I ended up spending 660 euros in airfare and checked baggage charges to get to London from Malaga (i.e., different airport than the one I had originally booked from). And because the luggage storage facility at Heathrow had closed by the time I eventually arrived, I ended up booking a night at a hotel since I couldn't travel by train to my cousin's place any longer (3 bags in tow) and I didn't want to put him out and have him drive to the airport to pick me up. This cost me another £125 in room and meal costs. All BA ended up doing to compensate me was to give me 5,000 free Avios - a mere pittance compared to my out of pocket expenses. Despite trying to explain to them why I requested the refund instead of calling them first, they wouldn't budge. Very easy for them to say what I should have done since they work there and know the rules and they weren't the ones scrambling to find alternative travel arrangements within a few hours. I pointed out that on their website they should simply instruct customers to call them when this situation happens, and that way they would never encounter this problem. My feeling is that they put the refund option out there in the hope that customers will make the mistake I did so they can then wash their hands of the situation and ultimately save money. I've been an Executive Club member for years and they simply didn't care. They said there was nothing they could do. I'm sure if one of the BA executive's friends or family members had gone through this, staff there would have been given the instruction to make things right. I used to be a fan of BA but they have really gone downhill in my opinion. Once I used up my remaining Avios and travel credit, I will cancel my Executive Club membership and never fly with them again.\n",

Seats had already been allocated for my wife and I - 41 E and F - which are the middle two seats of the central block of four. These were totally unsuitable for us as we are in our late 70's and getting in and out of seats to stretch our legs or go the the toilet would mean climbing over a person on the aisle. But there were no other seats available. We got to Heathrow about 6 hours before departure and tried to change seats at check-in, to no avail, although the lady was very sympathetic and tried her utmost. She did offer us an upgrade to Premium Economy but at 450GBP each it was beyond our affordability. She said we should try again at the departure gate but that also failed. We spoke to a member of the flight crew who was totally unsympathetic. The economy seats are so tiny that I was jammed shoulder to shoulder between by wife and a stranger, with knees touching the seat pocket in front. For 12 hours we suffered. When we did manage to get out of our seat due to the kindness of the young lady next to me on the aisle, it was a mission trying to clamber past the reclined backrest in front of me. BA Economy is absolutely awful. The evening meal was near-inedible - both choices were spicy foods which are not very suitable when flying, especially for an older person. The breakfast Spanish Omelette was, however, not bad at all. The previous day we had flown economy from Malta to Heathrow on Malta Airlines and that 3 hour trip was a pleasure.

The team tried to find a solution but none made sense, not even on the next day the 13th of May 2023. We have made full booking of accommodation, car rental, activities etc for the vacation in Iceland. The cancellation of of these booking is not refundable. The call center suggested that we cancel the flight for a full refund, then claim compensation for the delay and difference in airfare cost and other non refundable bookings due to the delay and cancellation of our flight. British Airways responded to the claim after a month with no compensation at all, even though we paid additional $600 on new bookings and additional charges. The refund of the cancelled flight took more than a month with multiple calla to follow up almost every week. I was promised to get refund on the first call but later I found out it was not processed properly. Every-time I call the agent ask questions about why flight was canceled etc which is annoying when my understanding everything was under process for payment. After multiple calls I was refunded partially and not the full amount which is even bizarre from a company of this level. I had to make more calls to get the remaining balance refunded. The whole experience was terrible.\n",

      "Review: Not Verified |  Cairo is a 5 hour flight and BA considers it to be short haul, so everyone is crammed in with knees pressed up against the seat in front and nothing in the way of inflight entertainment. Not even a magazine - which is now available by WiFi that you have to pay for. You have to pay for your seat choice, checked in baggage, food & drink, WiFi. Not that I have anything against that - I'm used to that on budget airlines - but this is for a premium price ticket. I would have preferred to fly on easyJet where the initial ticket would have been less, and the extras would have been half the price. The BA app and website makes it really difficult to understand the extras and we ended up with baggage on the wrong ticket so had to pay extra. And don't get me started on their customer service helpline. On board the staff are ok but on the long Cairo-London route they spend most of their time on a break where they use the back row or two and talk loudly without any consideration for the passengers. And for the flyers who don't want the hassle of charges, minimal cabin service, and budget seats, then they could easily provide a 'premium economy' option  and really make a difference for the experience. Heathrow Terminal 5 compounds the poor experience, especially for arrivals. It is also poorly served by transport links - especially for those of us who live near Gatwick which is being abandoned by BA. I have been a frequent flyer for many years - and was even a BA Gold Card holder at one point - so I know about the potential experience. I used be able to make the choice - do I fly budget, or do I fly more comfortably for more? Now it's a case of flying budget, or flying budget for double the price with BA. \n",

      "Review: Not Verified |  Beware of British Airways and their marketing to make you believe that they are full of class and level above the rest. They won't treat you that way when you get bumped from a flight and it is their responsibility to compensate you for their mistakes. We recently had a trip home planned from MRS to SEA. A mechanical issue meant that we departed late from MRS to LHR where we needed to make a connecting flight. We landed with plenty of time to make it to our next gate, but a series of issues and choices by British Airways kept us from boarding our next plane. The crew did not let off passengers with connecting flights first nor did they hold the next flight for a mere 5-10 minutes for passengers to make connections on their airlines. Plus, we discovered that we had actually been bumped off our next flight before we even landed. We were pushed to Virgin Atlantic to figure out how to get us home. It extended our travel day by 8 hours! We were traveling with children as well. No offers of compensation or upgrades were made. And now BA is refusing to provide us any financial compensation. We paid for a trip home with only one connection and instead had two connections, multiple airlines to deal with, security through an extra airport with kids for a midnight flight we were never planning on. That is not what we paid for but BA refuses to make it right. So beware potential travelers!\n",

The most surly customer service (can you even be called that when you treat people like this) answered. She kept calling me James (not my name). She was brutal. You accepted it. I can’t do anything. She basically made me feel like a moron because in a moment of confusion I accepted the first available flight from the stupid supercomputer. She kept telling me about the algorithm and this was the flight that was chosen. But if you had called us we could have put you onto a Aer Lingus flight! Why didn’t you call? You are at fault. Just so callous and uncaring. She wanted to charge me 600 pounds in new flights and change fees. I said nope and booked a flight today with Ryanair. Plus I need to find my way from Gatwick to Docklands. More money from me because of BA’s utter contempt for their passengers. I’ve been flying Qantas for 25 years and they can do some funky stuff.

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  I booked our first out of country trip to take my husband on a surprise trip to Monaco. I gave us over 3 hours for our connecting flight to and from home through Heathrow. Our flight left Seattle an hour late causing us to miss our connecting flight. We were rescheduled before we even landed. They booked us on a flight 7 hours later and offered no food tickets or any other type of reimbursement. Additionally we sat in their customer service line for an hour and a half to see if they could rebook us on an earlier flight, to watch them continually assist other customers that walked up outside of the queue (no earlier flights were available). When we arrived in Nice, France the airport was closed, including the rental car desk. We were not offered any assistance from the airline on a room or other accommodation for the night. We found a cab, which cost us 85 euros one one to get to our hotel. We thought there is no way something like this could happen on the way home….we were wrong. Our flight from Nice to Heathrow was 30 minutes late, with a 2.5 hour layover you would think we should still make our flight, unfortunately long security lines caused over 1.5 hr further delay. When arriving BA closed the doors and said they could not hold the plane any longer despite arriving 15mins before departure. After running through the Heathrow airport and going through security again. They sent us back to the customer service queue, where the first statement was we can’t get you out until tomorrow. After begging they found us a flight on another airline. At that time we were told our bags were transferred to our flight with Delta. We were given 8 pounds each for snacks at the airport for our now additional 5 hour delay. In total for our trip there and home we spent 13 hours at Heathrow airport which our original total layover of 6 hours, and we were offered 8 pound each. Unfortunately the drama continues. The two bags that they said made the Delta flight, shockingly did not. We were told that we had the file the claim with Delta, since the last part of our flight was with them. We have now been home for 5 days and each airline is pointing the finger at the other. As I said to both of them today. I don’t care who’ has my bags figure it out and send me my luggage I don't want your $500 reimbursement per bag, as that doesn’t come close to the memories and stuff that I have in there. I will never fly British Airways again, and Delta’s baggage people are not doing great either.\n",

I gave BA a chance to correct their mistake by contacting them after the flights but all they did was answer once with a lot of serious complaints that were involved with their flights and all they did was tell me to contact their partners that I had the last flight with, which went smoothly and they had nothing to do with the previously addressed complaints. I contacted them and gave them over a week asking why they didn't address any of my complaints that their partner could have nothing to do with and they just ghosted me. 2/10 for the kind personnel that's holding this airline together though.\n",

      "Review: Not Verified |  My itinerary was supposed to be Las Vegas-Chicago-London-Venice. When I landed in London Heathrow, I was stuck on the aircraft for 2 hours with no explanation as to why and because of such a delay I missed my connecting flight to Venice. Getting off the plane was when the real nightmare took place. Our flight had over 300 people aboard meaning many were in a rush to get to their flights or had already missed their flight. They put us into two lines, one of them being for people who missed their flight. I waited approximately 10 minutes just to come up to a clerk who told me \"Since I missed my flight I would have to go to the connecting flight BA service desks for further assistance.\" If I were to have known that was the only information I would receive I would have skipped being in that line altogether. When I went to the service desk where there were more than 60+ people standing in line, I waited 30+ minutes until a clerk came by passing everyone a pamphlet telling people to create an account online and to book our flights through the BA site since their systems were down and couldn't rebook anyone. It was a hassle doing anything through he BA site so I ended up calling the helpline. After waiting to be connected to a BA rep. I spoke with a woman who said I would have to call Iberia Airlines for a rebook, I called Iberia and they said since I booked through Expedia I would have to call them. Expedia then said I would have to call BA for the rebook so when I called BA again, the rep. said the only flight he could get me booked for was for the following Monday, mind you I was travelling since the 25th which was a Friday. All the hotels in the vicinity of the airport were booked, I was trying to figure out where my checked baggage went (I still don't have it), most of the customer service I got from BA reps was horrible service as if they could care less for the predicament their company caused me. They acted like I was inconveniencing them with \"my issues\". I also had to sleep in the airport waiting for my flight the next morning because hotels were booked.

      "Review: Not Verified | Top Ten REASONS to not use British Airways To all: Be Aware and be on Notice- Travel at your own risk I have travelled for years on many different airlines, and I have to say that British Airways ranks as one of the top two most horrible airlines to fly. Don’t waste your time or money. Customer service is non-existent. Please be on notice that if you purchase a ticket from them and once, they have your money, you can kiss any customer service and or help resolving your issue goodbye. We used them to travel to Europe and it was the worst experience I have had with an airline in years. When you work hard and save your money to travel, you expect a good experience. Welp not with this company. Who I am sure, makes millions on customers per year. I understand that sometimes things happen, but this started right after we booked our flight AND THE BAD EXPERIENCE DID NOT END UNTIL WE SET FOOT BACK TO OUR HOMETOWN. Please take note: #1 - The customer service number is buried on the internet and not listed on their website. I had to google it and still got the run around when someone finally answered. Trust me, the number is a secret. #2 – When you FINALLY find a customer service number, there is a long wait and when or if someone answers, they will not resolve your issues. Instead, they pass the buck to whatever airlines that they sold your ticket to. NO ONE TAKES OWNERSHIP #4- What airlines operates 365 days a year and around the clock but doesn’t have customer service reps to help you, the customer? BRITISH AIRWAYS that’s who. #5 - They will cancel your flight without notice and not notify you, AT ALL. NO EMAIL, NO TEXT. #6- If you are not the primary on your ticket you will get no notifications or even if you are the primary, you may or may not get notifications. #7 - If you pay for seats and you pick them, it doesn’t matter, they will cancel your seats and not refund your money and then play stupid. #8 - The flight may be cheaper, but it is not once you are done paying for seats. #9- They will route to another partner airline and not notify you #10 – If you have a connecting flight, they will cancel one leg and not the other and NOT NOTIFY YOU. I will never use them again. And if this review helps one person that heeds my advice, then my job is done.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |. The BA first lounge at Terminal 5 was a  zoo at 2pm, dirty tables and used tableware everywhere. Worse than this, the usual atrocious boarding gate service, and boarding started 50 mins late. The flight was operated by a Finnair A320, which is barely low cost standard let alone business class. Hard, thin, uncomfortable seats, poor legroom and the cabin was simply tatty - I remain shocked that BA allow this, and it's time for BA's CEO and management focused on standards rather than bean counting. Finnair cabin staff were fundamentally courteous, but they provide a very trimmed down, budget airline type service, as the whole trip turned out to be - and yet this business class ticket was one of the more expensive on recent trips. I thought post Covid that BA were better for a few months, but with the many cost cuts they are making, they fall well below all other European full service Airlines. \n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  I will never travel with British Airways again. I spent over $10,000 on a business class seat to attend a funeral in the UK. First, the Boeing 787-9 cabin has 7 seats across the aisle so what you are getting in reality is premium economy. The seats are narrow and effectively are a business class seat cut in half. They have squeezed these seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to go to the toilet, which wakes up that passenger. The whole point about business class is that you pay to rest and have privacy and not have someone push over the top of you. Second, the food was disgusting. Third, the service terrible. Fourth, the toilet was tiny. Fifth, the inflight screen was fixed and too high so I could not see anything. Sixth, their baggage handling is also appalling meaning that my taxi was waiting for 2 hours and I had to pay more (no free airport transfers with British Airways). Seventh, the charging points did not work. The second leg to London was on a larger plane with 4 seats across the aisle. That was bearable because no hopping over people but the seat was very uncomfortable because it was not one piece. This means that you are sleeping on a metal bar (the seat) where there is a gap in the seat. To add insult to injury I now find that both flights back to Sydney are on the small plane. To book a seat before check in is $170. I paid it but note that there were only 4 seats left. This is why I got the worst seat in the house going out. This is the most appalling airline service I have ever encountered. There is no point paying for business class in British Airways. \n",

Had a cancellation from Switzerland that forced us to spend the whole night in a cheap hotel and had to fly out the next day and then had another cancellation to Spain.

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  Despite being a gold member, the British Airways staff in Heathrow literally could not care in the slightest about the absolute turmoil and logistical damage or wider impact of their terrible service. All the staff members repeat the same mantra - “we are not obliged to provide even an update for the first 24 hours” as if that would make the situation better. There are no proactive updates, no empathy, no care but a lot of actual lies being told. You can tell that they have given up any care or thought for the passengers as actual individuals - they show this in every action and word they say. All of them are better suited to working away from other humans.\n",

      "Review: Not Verified | Regarding the aircraft and seat: The business class seats on this flight were pretty good. All were of the suite type, where every seat has its own booth with sliding door for extra privacy. The downside to this is that if you are travelling as a couple, its quite difficult to interact. There is ample storage and USB charging ports. The seat is pretty comfortable. As someone who finds it very difficult to sleep on flights, this was one of the only times I've been able to get a few minutes sleep here and there. The amenities provided are pretty average when compared to other airlines. The leather toiletry bag was quite nice though. No slippers, only a pair of socks. The restrooms on the flight are very small, and don't provide much in the way of toiletries compared to other airlines. No free Wi-Fi in Business Class is not acceptable. Another example of BA's penny pinching in recent years. Regarding the staff and customer service: Poor. Inattentive. Beyond meal times there was offer of water during the flight. I had to go and find an attendant and ask. There was also no offer of any snacks. Rude at times. My partner asked for a fork to be replaced as the one provided was quite clearly dirty. The attendant was incredibly rude in response. This left us shocked. Different customers seem to receive a different quality of service. A customer behind me was repeatedly greeted politely by name and asked how they were, whether they needed anything etc. whereas my partner and I were not afforded the same level of personal service. This is disappointing as we paid the same price for the tickets so expect the same level of service. The food was pretty bad. I had risotto while my partner had chicken. Both were extremely over cooked and the rice looked like porridge. The vegetables were discoloured and flavourless. The bread was nice though. The breakfast wasn't much better. Summary: BA has become the Ryanair of long haul. The customer service is way below what I would expect for a premium airline in a premium seat. You pay a premium price for a very average service. If there are other options available I would choose them over BA these days.\n",

      "Review: Not Verified | I travelled with British Airways from Sweden to Los Angeles via London in December 2022. When I arrived at LAX one of my bags were missing. There was no information of the whereabouts of my bag and after searching for someone for about 30 minutes, I found the point of contact and she told me my bag was left behind. I gave her my details of where I would be staying and she told me that they would contact me. After a few days and still no contact I tried to call British Airways customer service. The woman at the airport didn’t give me a file reference number, so it was quite difficult to try and locate my bag, but they finally found the reference number and my bag and said it would be delivered in a couple of days. I told them that I had switched hotels and gave them the address for where I was staying and everything was fine. But then a couple of weeks went by and my bag was still nowhere to be seen and it was time for me to fly home. At the airport I tried to talk with the personnel there to try and locate my bag and they said that it was delivered to the first hotel I stayed at, even though I had given them an updated address. I asked them what I should to since I was flying home now. The guy at the counter told me that it wasn’t his problem and that I should figure it out myself. I questioned him about his response and he just walked away. A manager saw that and came up to me and apologized for his colleague and that they would send someone to fetch my bag and send it with either my flight or the next one. I came home and a couple of days later I received my bag. I made a complaint and claims on British Airways website since I had to buy clothes and toiletries during my vacation because I didn’t have my bag. In January they said that they would refund me for my claims, it is now April (almost May) and I have still not received the refund even after multiple email conversations. I don’t know what to do anymore about this situation since it appears that no one is willing to help me. I am appalled about how the situation is being handled and frankly disappointed at British Airways and the lack of customer service.\n",

Seats in Premium economy was ok, but when the passenger in front reclines, there is very little space for the window seat passenger to cross over. Overall not a good airline.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  Worst experience of my life trying to deal with the customer service for British Airways. So many issues with getting from one destination to the other. Had an absolutely horrible time trying to get answers or reach anyone who was capable of helping navigate uncertainties. I wrote them a formal complaint requesting some type of refund and received a generic “we are sorry” email with 5000 avios attached which is equivalent to maybe $50 on a $600+ flight. Needless to say these will go to waste as I refuse to fly with an untrustworthy incompetent unorganized airline that couldn’t even address one single issue expressed to them. It was equivalent to handing me a band aid after slapping me in the face. I will say the flight itself was smooth and the onboard staff was kind and attentive. The most frustrating thing is that the customer service is trained to give you the runaround so heavily to the point of exhaustion that you just give up trying and take the loss.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  Due to code sharing with Cathay Pacific I was downgraded to BA on my return leg. I can’t describe how cheated I felt. I booked and paid for an airline with great entertainment, food and service, instead, I was forced to go hungry because they only had one choice of meal and it was inedible. To ensure the passengers didn’t get any funny ideas and assume that as the vegetarian option was unavailable they might be given a cracker or a small packet of nuts. The cabin crew announced in their uniquely aggressive and dismissive way “You won’t get anything else for 12 hours you know!” the entertainment is compiled mainly of B movies so I paid £11 for Wi-Fi so I could watch Netflix on my laptop. Unsurprisingly, the signal was so weak I couldn’t even send an email. To add insult to injury, the earbuds provided the cheapest and lowest quality I have ever seen. Since the last time I used this airline the crew are less rude and obnoxious and are now just impatient and unhelpful.  What I don’t understand is why it seems that British Airways look for these characteristics as desirable attributes for their crew. \n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  I wouldn't recommend British Airways at all. I tried to call to customer service for 3 times in different days and time and I waited for more than 30 minutes on the phone! I ended hanging up. They are excusing themselves in the high volume of calls. I write an email an I am still waiting for 2 weeks!  Website is difficult to navigate. It is not easy really to have an invoice of proof of receipt or look for another service. They sent you online but you don't receive a PDF file. So if you need a proof of flight, you need to do screenshots. And, once the flight is flown, you have no access to that booking again to reprint any document or try to create a PDF. You need to contact with a customer service which I did it online, long waiting time, and had to wait more than a week to receive it. Expensive and poor, almost inexistent customer service and difficult to use their website. An airline that definitely wouldn't recommend.

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrible experience. I booked a ticket from Expedia for a British Airways Operated flight from Madrid to Belfast with a changeover at London Heathrow. The whole itinerary was listed as BA although the Madrid to London flight was Iberia. On Jan 22nd, London was experiencing cold and fog. The Iberian flight sat on the tarmac for 2 hours in Madrid because of the London weather. Upon landing in Terminal 3, I had to take a bus to Terminal 5. The flight was the last flight to Belfast for the evening and it had already taken off. The BA desk was swamped with people as many people had to spend the night due to the weather. The British Airways staff said that we could go book any hotel up to 200 pounds and we would be reimbursed. I was barely able to find a room and had to take an expensive cab. However when trying to get the reimbursement, BA said it wasn't their problem and that it was Iberia's problem. Iberia said they do not reimburse due to the weather. When complaining to BA, they said they only market the flight as BA and that they refuse to reimburse. Absolutely disgusting behavior by the airline to not take any responsibility for a flight that they were using their name to sell it to people but don't want to take responsibility for it. Did they expect me to take the bus back to Terminal 3? Their people gave out false information.\n",

There were a few aisles —not separated in any way—in which they simply put a tray on the middle seat so that no one sits there.

When we got to the hotel which is around 10:15pm the staff informed that dinner closes at 10:30. that was a rush. It appeared more of a Motel than an hotel. The room - was smelling of weed, being a non-smoker this was uncomfortable. Although I wanted to compromise and rest, when I went to wash my face, the tap on the sink came off in my hands, I panicked and asked the reception staff to change my room.

Get to LCY, showing as cancelled on screen, so check the app and there it is.

The 18.35 to AMS was already overbooked so was moved onto the 19.30 flight to Rotterdam. The 15.30 and 18.35 were both cancelled anyway, as it happened. Eventually took off and the best thing I can say is that it landed intact. Return from AMS-LHR, similar story. Arrive at AMS, screen shows the 21.00 is cancelled. Quickly check app, and confirmed it was. No emails, no texts, nothing. Rebooked via app to the 22.00 departure, so could have been worse. Desk agent helpfully printed me a boarding card as the app was unable to issue anything for a rebooked flight. Overall, dreadful. They just don't care and hide behind apps and automated call centres.

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  The usual shambolic unfolding that BA has now unfortunately been come to known for. We had a long weekend flight booked to Munich that was supposed to be departing on 9th February at 19:55. This happened to be our first flight with our newborn (3 month old) daughter. It turned out to be a horror show of incompetence. Just under 3hrs before scheduled departure, the original 9th February flight was cancelled. We received an email as we were boarding the Heathrow express. I’d booked a day of holiday off work for this trip. We ended up getting doing a round trip to Paddington instead. On the way back from the cancelled flight, both me and my wife tried calling BA. Despite one of us having silver membership (possibly the largest joke of a membership currently out there), I took us nearly 45 minutes to speak to someone who could help. I believe BA outsource their call centres and so you end up talking to people who are following a script. The result is that you might as well be speaking to an AI rather than a human. We often received the response similar to ‘computer says no’. If this is the service level for silver members I can’t imagine what a regular punter has to put up with. When the phone originally connected to a person, I had to wait 5 minutes as his computer booted up. - BA then proceeded to auto-book us onto a new flight for the next day but going to a different destination. Our original flight was to Munich and the auto-booked replacement flight was to Salzburg. When asking the robot at the BA call centre why they booked us on a replacement flight to a location 135km apart, they couldn’t understand my frustration.  Eventually, someone was able to book us onto a flight the following day at 17:00. Not ideal as I’d wasted a valuable day off work and the hotel wouldn’t refund us or move our booking, but at least we were going to Munich and not Salzburg. - The day of the new flight came round and, this time, we managed to get all the way to the check in desk. Upon arriving at the check in desk, we were told that our rebooked flight had just been cancelled 4 minutes earlier. No email. No text. No notification ever arrived from BA to tell us that the flight had been cancelled. Incomprehensible as to how this could have possibly happened. The check in person said I should get on the app to rebook. At this point, I didn’t know whether to explode with anger or cry. Luckily, another check in person had an ounce of sympathy and explained to the useless check in person that he could actually rebook us. We were booked onto another flight later that evening (19:55 - BA0958). Unfortunately, that meant 5hrs in the grotty lounge with a 3 month old baby. It appears that everyone now has access to a lounge and so there’s really no difference between the lounge and a hostel, other than you get free stuff in the former. This was not a pleasant experience. We did eventually arrive in Munich and, despite asking, didn’t get our push chair/stroller delivered to the front of the plane. The plane was a characteristically BA dumping ground - they used to give you sanitising wipes so you could clean your seat and tray table down but they seemed to have cut back on this service too. All in all, another shocking BA service. A lost day of holiday and not an an ounce of empathy/sympathy/understanding at all from any of the employees I interacted with.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  The incoming and outgoing flight was delayed because French Air Traffic Controllers were on strike so we were routed over Germany, and not BA's fault. O arrival the pilot announced we could not pull onto the stand as no ground crew had showed up to turn on the automatic last metre guidance. It took around 40 minutes to find someone. Then when that was done there was a further delay as there were no ground staff to operate the skybridge. All told we were trapped on the plane for over an hour within metres of our gate. Total disruption, wasted time. Absolutely no excuse for this.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  Back in December my family and I as we were getting onto the plane were refused. Even though we had boarding passes and seats allocated and had booked 6 months in advance we were refused. It turns out that someone had not turned up to work and they couldn't let all the passengers on the plane. So quite randomly (not) 9 people were selected and turned away. We were selected as we had no check in luggage and it was easier to boot us off despite them not knowing my circumstances, if I had connecting flights in London etc. I sought compensation from BA (which I was told I could do) and what an absolute nightmare this process has been. They wouldn't acknowledge my complaint for my family until I had an authorisation letter from them saying I could act on their behalf. Even though, I booked and paid for the tickets. So, I uploaded the authorisation letter no less than 10 times. Every time they told me they received it and every time I followed it up they told me they hadn't. There was no other way except to post from Australia to the UK to some office. Eventually, it finally go through to them. I have now chased up the reimbursement four times. Each time they tell me it has been sent and to be patient. Today they tell me that they need to check my account details. So, again, I send them the same information that I have done before. AND I wait patiently for my reimbursement. I am convinced that their business model is for you to get so frustrated you just go away. Well, you know what I won't.\n",

Penny pinching means there’s no other benefit - one drink service on 10 hour flight, no fizz offered before take off, poor food, boarding was badly organised. Food left on tables 30 min before landing with no tea and coffee offered. Few small cups of water passed around but nothing “premium” about this. New planes have been decorated terribly - feels like you’re in a dentist waiting room. Devoid of any personality or joy. Only fly if the only option, only fly premium if it’s not too expensive - seriously not worth much more than economy these days, especially if you’re in the middle 4.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  My review relates to the appalling experiences I had with British Airways on 14th February 2023. I was due to travel to Madrid with British Airways and before setting off I heard on the radio that there were flight delays. I looked at the Heathrow Airport website and saw that my flight had been cancelled. As a result of the information on the website, I called British Airways and have 26 minutes on hold I found myself speaking to somebody in a call centre in South Africa. The person was hard to understand due to a heavy accent and he was incompetent and insisted that the flight was not cancelled. I made my way to Heathrow and sure enough the flight was indeed cancelled. The woman in question had the audacity to declare that the flight was cancelled and that “there are no facilities here at the airport to rebook you”. She refused to let me and about 12 other people join the queue for the clearly marked assistance desk. The same woman and one of her colleagues gave out a card with a telephone number and told one rather elderly gentleman to “go online to rebook your seat”. I am visually impaired and found the attitude of the BA employee to be appalling. I called the number on the card the employee gave me and was again in a long queue to a call centre. The person who picked up the phone kept me waiting 22 minutes and declared that the flight was not cancelled and that the airport “must be wrong”. He then in a flippant tone said he was just informed that the flight was indeed cancelled and that I would have to go and speak to IBERIA customer services in Heathrow to rebook! I took the elderly gentleman with me to IBERIA where the counter staff member rolled her eyes in disgust and said that it was nothing to do with IBERIA. I returned to BA and this time I joined the check-in line and told a check-in agent what had happened. The man in question booked me onto the next available flight within a matter of a few minutes. He gave me a £30 voucher as a form of compensation but said he could not add my frequent flyer number with a partner airline. The voucher proved useless I am afraid as various shops in the predepature area refused to accept it and although I was told I could use it after clearing security none of the shops would accept it. Once aboard my new flight the service was minimal. Other than a tiny bottle of water and a packet of pretzels nothing else was available. This was a full flight as so many people had been transferred from the cancelled flight. BA Cabin crew announced that any additional items other than the small bottle of water and pretzels had to be ordered via their skyshop.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  Outward journey BA245 London to Buenos Aires Club World 10 January 2023. Our experience was poor from beginning to end. Although we had reserved seats 11F and 12J, another passenger was occupying 11F and crew made no attempt to address the problem. Eventually, I persuaded the passenger to move and occupy her designated seat 11D. We boarded punctually but were not offered drinks. When I asked for a drink, the crew member said it was too late and blamed the seating problem. The same crew member then began taking orders for dinner but did not write them all down and gave up after a few minutes for the safety briefing. She asked us to repeat our orders later. The hot flannels smelled musty and felt old and ragged.  One of the crew wondered aloud whether my companion and I were related.  My soup was cold, I was told it was served from flasks. Was that an explanation or an excuse? My coffee was weak and tasted like instant granules. My companion was initially served no bread roll with dinner. The breakfast menu stated a 'selection of rolls/pastries' but there was no choice and my companion was given a dried fruit pastry, where he would have chosen a bread roll.  Although we had not previously asked for or been offered any other than those supplied at the seat, small bottles of water ran out. Return journey BA244 Buenos Aires to London Heathrow World Traveller Plus 26 January 2023 was a huge contrast, from the warm welcome on boarding to crew’s professionalism throughout. It’s a poor reflection on Club World service that our experience in World Traveller Plus was so much better and kinder. Weighed against the advantages of a flat bed, the considerable price difference was not worth paying for the catalogue of errors and inconveniences outlined above.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  This flight was one of the worst I have ever had in my life. I wanted to pamper myself, so I bought business class. I was looking forward to my new experience. I will not mention the chaos of changing gates several times, as these things may happen. What surprised me was the lack of attention to passengers. The flight was delayed by almost 3 hours. Even though staff offered vouchers, we had no idea where to get them, and we were told that we only had about 10 minutes to use them because boarding had already begun. Firstly, I did not see anyone with the voucher, and secondly, even if we got it, we were not able to use it. When I finally got to the airport, there was another waiting for about 30 minutes after cross check. Meantime, we were told that due to problems, they did not load any food, so the flight will be without any food on board. The only food offered and given to everyone on the plane was a small bag of nuts. As a business class passenger, I was offered drinks only. All in all, my business class contained 3 small glasses of juice.   I received no apology or compensation from the company at all. It was a disgraceful and cheap service for a very expensive price. \n",

However the form to start the submission process is hopelessly broken. After clicking \"submit\" the form just hangs forever. No error message is given.

I have travelled using major airlines my whole life and although I know it sounds silly - when on a 4 hour flight on a major airline you do expect some form of beverage or snack as a curtesy and a port to charge your phone and not have to pay insane prices for luggage. There was no inflight entertainment and the aircraft was very snug, when I challenged why I had to pay for my own drink and why no inflight entertainment - I was told it was a short haul fight. My sisters met me from Cairo (which is an hour and half flight) and flew Egyptair and somehow received luggage allowance, drinks, food and inflight entertainment as well as a USB port to charge their phones. BA I now realise stands for Budget Airline. Staff were great - what you got for your money not so much.\n",

Although combine the IFE with the cheap and nasty earbuds, and any movie can be ruined. Headrest was great, just a pity little padding is used on the seat as my Wife and I were very uncomfortable. The leg room in general is poor, especially when passengers keep their seat reclined from start to finish. Zero room. Aircraft was tired. Rubber spacers falling out, silicone sealer falling apart in the toilets. Toilet seats old, stained. Rubber on arm rest was hanging off. No post take off drinks/snacks offered.  Meal was sent out after a couple of hours. Was poor. Chicken cubes that reminded me of dog food, mashed potatoes that were purified within an inch of their life. Stale rock hard roll, salad which was rice and carrots?! Dried crackers with no cheese. Kids meal was just as sad. Tiny leaf salad with enough dressing to refloat a shipwreck. Coffee creamer was given with the kids meal? Snack was decent for the adults, bagel with cheese and egg. Hot and tasty. Kids snack was a green wrap with spinach and onions in it.  Very very poor. Mix the food, BA service with a grunt, being crammed into a seat for 7 hours, landing at a remote stand and enduring a bus to the terminal and BA in my opinion, is terrible. This flight was so disappointing. Other than one great member of cabin crew, everything else was just average.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified | Probably the worst business class experience I've ever had on an airline. Just a few of the issues: Required to purchase seats on international (Club World) business class. This was not made known during the ticket purchase process and cost me an additional $600 on a single leg (LHR-LAX) for a family of four. Given the very strange business class seating layout on BA A380s, leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my family. Ridiculously long boarding times on even small aircraft. On my VIE-LHR leg, the boarding time for the A320 was over 50 minutes long, leading to a delayed departure. There was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding times. Severe overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite C of terminal 5 at Heathrow. Boarding staff would not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area before boarding (I have no idea why not) and so crowding was extreme. The overall boarding area was far too small for an A380, and I believe this satellite was designed and built after the first A380s were delivered. Online check-in in advance of flights appears to be completely broken. I was urged repeatedly (on the BA website, and via email and text) to \"upload my COVID documents\" even though, at the end of 2022, there are no COVID documents required for travel. After I filled in basic contact information on the website - and did not upload any \"COVID documentation\" - I was informed (several hours later) that my \"COVID documents have been verified\". I then received another text message urging me to \"upload my COVID documentation\". On the VIE-LHR leg, the shop.ba.com page that one is directed to after attempting to connect to wifi on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight times - over six hours, and then four hours just before landing. BA lounges for Club Europe and Club World at Heathrow are often seriously overcrowded. Furniture and carpeting and other finishes in the clubs are worn or dirty. That said, the food in the lounges was of pretty good quality. The food quality in BA lounges at Heathrow may be the only redeeming thing about this airline. Onboard, food and beverage service was far below average for international business class. Terrible, one might say. On the LHR-LAX leg, there was no pre-meal beverage service and there were NO mid-flight beverage services at all. Unlike most business class offerings on other airlines, there was no taking a meal order by flight attendants at the beginning of the flight. Meals were brought out haphazardly shortly after take off, with the \"chicken or fish?\" type of meal selection similar to economy class. There was no coffee or tea service after meals. Food quality was poor, with the pre-landing snack of a \"ploughman's lunch\" being downright disgusting. . There was no beverage or bar set-up in the galley areas - beverages available to passengers during the flight - as is standard on most international business class offerings. Even bottles of water seemed be hidden away, requiring one to ask the flight attendants for water. I won't comment on the bizarre seating layout on the A380, as others have rightly panned the awkwardness and extremely poor design of the seating. The seats are not 6' 2\" long as stated on the BA website, and I found the seats too short for my 6' 2\" height. The \"Priority\" luggage tags were not followed in the baggage delivery.\n",

My attendant saved me from crying.

Seat was nice enough. Stowage pocket in front a bit small. Food was reasonably nice. Shame that the bathroom is all the way back through economy and there is a bit of a queue. IFE system is good but selection mediocre. Worst part of the flight is that at CPT so we were on a remote stand and bussed in. Through passport control quickly but then it took an absolute age to get our luggage which ruined what would otherwise have been a reasonable flight. Upgrade was worth it at £200 maybe £300 (its a long flight) but their offers of £2000 or whatever for premium economy is comedy pricing. Score before the luggage fiasco would have been 7 or 8 / 10.

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  Vancouver to Delhi via London. We were booked to fly from Vancouver to New Delhi via London Heathrow on Dec 22nd. We received an email on Dec 20th informing us about the industrial action in the UK. I called to find out how it may impact our travel. The representative kind of scared us of being possibly stranded during our travel and offered us a full refund. We called again to confirm about other options but he did not offer any other solutions. We asked to cancel our tickets and he told us about the cancellation fee. We booked new tickets with another airline with double the cost as our trip was urgent (simultaneously). He told us he no longer can cancel our tickets on the system but promised us he will make it happen because he told us we would get a full refund. He processed the cancellation. 5 hours later he emailed us that the tickets couldn’t be cancelled and suggested we cancel our new tickets once he found out they were with another airline (we lost $1000 from cancelling the new tickets). Now, the representative claimed that he never said there won’t be any services available and asked us why we were worrying about the industrial action, and that other “arrangements” will be made if there were any issues (this was new information never given to us before). We kept our British Airway tickets. The next day, we asked to speak with the manager and report that we were misguided about the whole situation. We never heard back from the manager. As we logged in to check-in 15 hours before take off, we found that our VAN — LHR flight was cancelled (due to the bad weather in Vancouver). We did not receive any emails from the airport nor the airline about this change. We called BA again and asked about rearrangements for our flight, to which they offered rebooking with an additional $700-1000 per person price difference and the dates offered were about 7 days after our original flight was supposed to leave. Additionally, to cancel the rest of the flights with them which we could not reach since our first flight was cancelled, we had to pay about $1000 cancellation fee to get a refund. We were very frustrated with the overall experience and no accommodations nor accountability as they wanted to charge us for any service or changes possible. We were on the phone for 1.5 hours while other flights that we could have booked were getting sold out - the customer service person would take 15-20 minutes (for real) to search up each question or option we asked about. It has been a frustrating experience - we lost time and money and it ruined our holidays completely. We then demanded to speak to the manager, who again did not want to take any accountability for their team and gave us a small discount on the cancellation fee. In total, we were on the phone with them for 2 days back and forth, without any resolutions. We felt misguided and misinformed with their unfair policies towards their customers. We did not feel taken care of at all. We had to pay the price for the misinformation and the flights we did not cancel ourselves. After all this trouble, we spent Christmas without our family and the missed the urgent reasons we were travelling for. \n",

I had to book a flight home with Lufthansa which cost €500 for an economy seat, but at least it got me home to Heathrow (all be it another terminal) on the Friday night so I could get home to family. I still have had no news on a refund of the €500 2 months on. It's such a shame, flying BA used to be such a pleasurable experience.

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  I was flying to Warsaw for one day of meetings and would be flying back out to Miami the next day. Initially my flight was delayed in Denver by 3 hours. As such I knew I would miss my connection in Warsaw. The Denver to Heathrow flight was terrible. The plane was dirty, I was in economy, I usually fly business or Premium Economy but on this flight there was no availability. The plane was only about 2/3 full and the service was not good. My food was inedible and the seats very cramped although the middle seat was open so that made it tolerable. When i arrived in Heathrow it was a complete circus. Passengers everywhere trying to rebook missed connections. Not only my flight but multiple other flights had missed connections. After waiting in line for an hour I was finally rebooked on another BA flight to Warsaw. This plane was the smallest 3x3 plane I have seen. Packed in like sardines. My bag never showed up so i had to cancel my meeting and now have no bag to fly back to Miami. BA has shown no desire to help other than to give me standard answers and that hopefully my bag will show up in Miami at some point and I can retrieve it from there. I mean the bag is sitting in Heathrow somewhere with 6 different fight options to get it to Warsaw yet BA in unwilling to do anything to expedite getting my bag to Warsaw before I leave for Miami the next day. \n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified | This is the worst experience I have ever had with any airline. I flew with British Airline on August 21st 2022. I had one checked bag that was lost at Heathrow Airport. I am aware that at that time there was a system error with the baggage belt and many travelers were affected. I filed a report for my missing bag on the same day I arrived at LAX airport, and that was on August 21st. I waited patiently for three weeks (which is the time frame to either find the bag or be eligible for a compensation). When I did not receive any update on my lost bag, I filed a claim for compensation, and that was on September 11th. Since then, I have been waiting for a response from the customer relation with no good signs of resolving the issue. I emailed them and tried to update the claim but still no response until today. I contacted the baggage team and they were not helpful and did not ease my prolonged waiting. The only way to contact customer relations is via the website and they're not even getting back to me. Every time I talk to a customer service agent, they tell me to wait some more. I have been waiting for almost three months now and my issue is not resolved yet. This whole experience was a hassle. Very unprofessional for a renowned airline like BA.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  Flying LHR T5 to CPT November 2022:  BA app and website not working properly - would not load my ticket. LHR T5 smooth and calm. Checking process quick. - But boarding card would not scan at security, they gave me one for someone else to a different destination.  Ran back to checkin to get correct one. Bags also tagged incorrectly and had disappeared.  Someone ran off to find my bags in the depths of T5 and retag them (amazingly they did show up in Cape Town).  Told only main lounge was open not B and C pier lounges. Turns out this was false information ... B Pier lounge was open. But I was in main lounge which was overcrowded and worn out. -Arrived late to the gate (train not working). There was a Biz class lane (quick) but then a giant queue to get on the plane as they only had one airbridge, not two. Seat comfy and cabin clean but the sinks were taped up as the waste was not working. I was offered hand sanitiser instead but this is disgusting (imagine going to the bathroom and not being able to wash your hands as there is no sink). Unbelievable that BA dispatches planes in this condition. Food average. Wine served way too late (choice of wine with cold food, or eat food first and matching wines come a quarter of an hour later). Overall experience 2/10. Flew Air France (Fortalaza to CDG to LHR) two weeks earlier which was way better. How embarrassing for BA.\n",

Boarding was done by zones so that was carried out reasonably well. Once on board, the FAs were fine, not as engaging on my outbound flight to IAD. The aircraft was cramped and the seats in economy were horrible. I was seated in an aisle seat (row F) where there is an entertainment box taking up a third of your legroom. Overall, very cramped seat, poor legroom and awful IFE screens. The meal was mediocre and there was no bar service before the meal this time. On lading, we were served a hot sandwich which had oozing cheese all over the wrapper so it was not pleasant to handle but tasted very good! The plane landed at a remote stand which meant that we had to be bussed to T5 and since it was raining, it was not a nice experience. Overall, I rate this just as a mediocre journey.\n",

Mentioning to a crew member that their colleagues were talking loudly made no difference at all. My second meal was something inedible, no way to get a simple bag of crisps or nuts, instead an assortment of dried something. Baggage took 3/4 hour to be delivered and had no priority for Club or even First passengers; we were all kept waiting after many economy bags had been delivered. A380 is a great aircraft but the BA seating is still the very tired old yin/yang configuration with some people stuck in the middle of 3 seats (probably not what anyone is expecting in business class these days)\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  We boarded our flight at Edinburgh to London for our connecting flight to San Francisco on 4th October, there were a lot of Americas heading back to America from Scotland because of the Open Golf at St Andrews. The woman at the counter was rude, I was actually embarrassed to be British at the time. Shouting, snapping at people and just had a real horrible way about her. On the flight from London to San Francisco, prior to the 24 hour check in, I spent £150+ to reserve two seats for our once in a life time holiday to America. Once we boarded, it was evident that the seat I was sitting in was broken. The recliner button was not working and had been pushed into the frame of the arm rest. I asked the flight attendant at the time of there was anything that could be done, but not only was she also rude, but seemed uninterested in that fact that I was going to have to sit for 11 hours on a flight with a seat that wouldn't recline. I eventually got the flight to state that she would report the fault, only to find out that multiple other seats on the economy seating area were also broken. Attitude with British Airways staff has been absolutely horrendous. So, after getting off the flight, I decided to make a complaint to British Airways. Bearing in mind that I had paid £150+ for the privilege of picking a seat. I asked for a refund for the cost of the booking of the seat prior to the 24 hour check in, only to be told no, they don't do refunds. I paid for a product that was broken, met with nothing but rude staff, and they are telling me they can't refund the cost of booking the seat? 4 emails to the customer team and they are still refusing, they are also refusing to tell me whether or not that the fault was reported prior to me sitting in that seat. All they have now offered me is a £50 BA voucher, which I declined on the basis that if they picked my seats (for example I hadn't payed for the seats prior to the 24 hour check in) then a £50 voucher would be ok, but not when I have spent my own money to select a seat that was broken. After all my experiences with BA, I will not be using them again. Very rude and unhelpful staff and I will chose another carrier in the future, im actually ashamed that BA treats people the way they do when they are a national airline for Great Britain.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified | The check-in process was smooth. I got access to the IGA Lounge which was nice, but not as nice has the Turkish Airlines Lounge. On board was what all this flight was about. This was my first time flying Intra-European Business Class, and though I was well prepared, I still found it underwhelming. First, the seat is just a normal economy seat, with the middle seat blocked off. There is no personal IFE, so basically no entertainment for a 3-hour flight. Meal service was very slow, and by the time it reached half of the business class cabin, one of the 2 choices ran out, plus the meal was not as good as the economy meal I got on my Turkish Airlines flight a few days ago. I could see that staff did their best, but since there were 32 business class passengers on a single aisle aircraft with a small galley, there was so much they could do. Also, the 32 passengers shared one single WC, meaning a long line for the bath room, something I have rarely seen in business class. Arrived at LHR, we did not get a contact gate, but the thing was that there was no bus either, and the crew announced that they had no idea when the bus would come. It finally came, of course, and the delay was more on the airport than the airline, but since BA is the main operator at Heathrow T5, such things will affect their reputation.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  My 7am flight for a conference in June was cancelled with less than 12h notice - without being given any alternative flight or rebook me upon alternative flight. Upon calling customer service, customer service who said she can only get me a flight 2 days later. They did not work with me as I miss 2 days of conference. They asked me to travel to a different airport in Sweden (Stockholm); which I reluctantly agreed to as I was not given any other choice - but I had to pay for that domestic flight myself. Upon reaching the Gothenburg airport on the day of departure, I saw a direct flight to Heathrow, called customer service and was told there is 1 seat available. So I changed to 8.15am from Gothenburg - Heathrow - Jersey. However, at this point BA told me I have to pay a fee of GBP 710 as I “changed my flight a 2nd time”.  I find it a disgrace that BA charge a fee to change a flight that they cancelled, and they were unable to give alternative options to reach my destination in for the conference. BA proposed that I travel to another airport in Sweden at my own expense. I have since contacted BA for the legal compensation I’m entitled to according to UK law, but I got a rejection as they claim I arranged my own travel to my destination. If I have a choice, I will never travel BA again. Such awful customer service and complete lack of understanding of customer needs.\n",

This should not have been a problem as the flights were re-bookable. We were given a voucher. This voucher was only bookable by phone. When I phoned to rebook, we got the automated voice saying BA were not taking flight bookings by phone. You can see the problem - how do a use a voucher where I must phone and they are not taking phone bookings ? All I have been offered is another voucher. The time to use has passed. It must be great to be a business that can print endless A4 vouchers and not return money paid for services not rendered. We returned home with Aer Lingus with no drama.\n",

Where is the decency? In addition to the stress of losing her husband, my sister had to go through totally unnecessary stress of not having a ticket until 7 days before her flight.

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  My wife and I booked a flight in April 2022 that included a return trip from Edinburgh thru London to Washington. When we checked in at Edinburgh Airport 3 hours ahead of time we were informed there were no more seats available on our scheduled flight. We asked how this was possible and were simply told that others had checked in on-line (which we hadn’t done).  We were instructed to come back in 2 hrs and 15 mins, still with our luggage unchecked and not yet going thru security, to see if we could get on the flight via standby. We waited and then finally at 1:15 PM, 45 mins before our scheduled 2:00 PM flight, we were told we could be on the flight and were given boarding passes for the flight to London but no boarding passes for the connecting flight (1:55 mins after arrival time). Our luggage was not checked thru to Washington but only to London. We were told we’d get thru security on time to make the flight and it was suggested that staff would assist us. When we got to Security Check area the line was massively long. We questioned a BA staff member who said we had to get in line like the others. We decided to pay (12 pounds) to go through “Fast Track” Security to make our Flight. We got to the gate in time. Yet, due to a delayed departure caused in part by luggage-space issues on the plane, our flight arrived in London 45 mns late, and after going to the “flight connections” we were told 25 mins before the scheduled departure, with a vague explanation of “there isn’t enough time,” that we could not be given a boarding pass for our flight. We were then directed to baggage claim to retrieve our luggage and then proceed to the check-in area to be rebooked for a later flight. When we got to the check-in counter area a BA staff person, standing at entrance to the check-in line, advised us we should try to call our travel agency to rebook because the line for checking in had not hardly moved in 3 hrs. When we finally got thru on the phone, we were informed that the best BA could do for us was to get us on a flight 5 days later, and then not to our original destination (IAD), but to Baltimore. I was not told or assured I’d be compensated for this extreme expense of staying 5 more days in a hotel - just that I could go to the BA website and make a claim on-line.

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  Three flights, London to Reykjavik return and Frankfurt to London. Generally the flights were of an acceptable standard, though the seats and legroom are quite tight for a three-hour flight. The cabin crews were efficient and generally friendly. A big plus for BA was informative announcements from the cockpit, often missing on other airlines. Flights operated generally close to the advertised times. But BA was let down by chaotic check-in and boarding procedures. In preparation for each flight the number of check-in staff was one or at most two (in Frankfurt the lone check-in agent was also checking in Business Class passengers). Why are Economy class passengers boarded from the front and not from the back? This was standard across the three flights, but slowed down the boarding process immensely as people seated further back tried to get past forward seated passengers stowing their (enormous) cabin baggage. It would make much more sense to board people at the back first. And to enforce baggage rules so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passengers who boarded last. The small bottle of water and a half-full bag of crisps offered as a snack on a three-hour flight to Iceland was just tokenism and compared badly with what Air France offered on a subsequent short flight to Paris. At Reykjavik there was no departure lounge next to the gate -- passengers had to queue wherever they could in the corridor.\n",

The email also stated that if I wasn't happy with the new seat selection they had made for me, I could get a full refund of the money I had paid. I called to cancel the reservation, which they did, and I paid $200 cancelation fee and they refunded my frequent flyer miles.

The seating spacing in economy class seems very tight and if the seat in front is fully tilted back, it is a real challenge to get out of the seat. The screen becomes so close to your face it becomes difficult to focus on the screen. Audio was so poor due to music drowning the conversation, I gave up trying to watch. The cabin crew seemed to really struggle with service, it felt very disorganised. Felt sorry for the cabin crew they seemed to be working hard and there seems to be a lot of up and down the aisles on this type of aircraft - felt unnatural. The overhead bins are very high and many passengers had difficulty accessing their belongings during the flight. I tried using the overhead attendant light to verify my wife's meal but no one responds - better to stop a flight attendant in the aisle.

We stated no good for two elderly people from Australia as would not know when we can travel. Informed no other option and silly vouchers sent. Now they are running out of date and unusable! Have been asking for two years for refund! Many many emails. They keep saying we took vouchers! Had no choice. Does anyone have any other options re complaints! We would be most grateful. Really not fair to just take our money! \n",

      "Review: Not Verified |  We left MIA late due to an issue with the provisioning of the plane. We arrived late and so missed our connection at LHR to CDG. At LHR British Airways rebooked us on not 1 but 3 flights to CDG and as such said I never took the flight to CDG and then cancelled my flight back to MIA since I did not take my flight. They did credit my AVIOS for the one flight but said I never took it. Thus I had to book on another airline to return at the last moment. Trying to call BA was a nightmare on hold for over 1 hour, a total of $127 extra on my calling plan only to not be helped as the person did not know what to do so he had us contact duty office who does not handle “flight only” problems feeding us back to the number we just called and we’re unable to be helped. BA cost me $5800 overall. We have flown them for years reaching silver and gold status but never again. They under new leadership have sunk to less than a budget low cost airline in customer service while charging premium rates - don’t be fooled.\n",

      "Review: Not Verified |  The customer service of British Airways is really bad. You can't reach any call centre agent even after waiting for 30 mins. Now, I really appreciate Emirates and Turkish Airlines after facing BA's low quality customer service. Not only the customer service but the food they offer during a long haul (LDN-JNB) is really low quality. Other airline operators which are working with Do&Co for flight catering are way better than BA. I guess BA has selected the lowest budget option from Do&Co. Overall my rating is 2/5 for BA - you can feel how stingy BA is when you fly with them. Note: Respect to their cabin crew\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  This a new route which BA introduced at the beginning of June after several years of Covid related delays. The business class experience was I fear typical of the nickel & dime policies introduced by the airline over the past decade. Plus - helpful and friendly FA. Minuses - The cabin was fairly cramped with six seats across. Each pod had surprisingly little room with only very limited storage space. It was hard to adjust the seat, particularly getting it to lie flat - even the FA found it difficult. The in-flight entertainment was very limited with a poor choice of films, TV programmes and music. The food choice and quality was poor - one of the three mains was unavailable and my pea and mushroom risotto was almost inedible: the cheese selection was also poor. I don't know what the business class offerings from BA's rivals flying similar routes are like, but the experience does not match up to that provided by Singapore Airlines on their flights to the Far East and Australasia.\n",

Flight to London was late, we auto missed our flight to Edinburgh, and had to wait 9 hours for the next flight. Coming back once again flight leaving was late, had to run to get connecting flight, then we sat on tarmac for an hour because luggage had to go on so I thought good, that is probably my luggage. Once back in Boston luggage did not show up. They said we would get it within 24 hours and we didn't, so far it will be at least 2 days.\n",

Flight was delayed arriving at Vancouver from London, which meant that departing flight from Vancouver was also delayed. Passengers waited almost 90 minutes at London Terminal 5 for baggage to arrive - excuse given by BA ground staff was that the baggage staff are \"very busy right now\" and our baggage will arrive \"soon.\" Onboard amenities and services quite disappointing. Seat was reasonably spacious but did not offer sufficient back support. Meal sizes and portions considerably smaller than when I last flown with BA - a tiny ham and cheese croissant for breakfast. Cabin crew noticeably absent from cabin during flight - no offer of water, juice, or other beverages during the flight. Overall, a fairly disappointing experience with BA.\n",

Once in Hamburg, there was no one at the baggage tracing desk and the number provided was a dead-end; no ability to leave a message or connect to an employee. A group of passengers all missing checked baggage waited in the airport and tried every outlet possible (check-in desk, other baggage tracing desks, calling, emails) for two hours to no avail. The solution for us was to fill out a sheet of paper with contact info and baggage description. Four days later, no information where my luggage is and no way to contact customer service. Absolutely miserable customer support. Our flights were alright but after such bad customer service we will never fly BA again.\n",

After 1.5 hours at the ticket counter we were given boarding passes. We were group 1 but the delay caused us to board much later. The connecting flight was cancelled leading to a day long layover with 4 children including an infant. The ultimate connecting flight was also 2 hours late. Then they lost our luggage, 4 days later they still don't have our luggage. Calling the helpline for lost luggage results in a 30 minute to 1 hour hold after which you are disconnected without speaking to anyone.

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  As a seasoned traveller and a loyal BA customer I am appalled at the company’s recent drop in standards. We were booked to fly from ZHR-LHR on a miles ticket in February 2022. When we arrived at check in several hours before our scheduled departure we were informed that we would have to pay for our baggage even though our ticket clearly included free checked baggage. We were held at check in for over an hour whilst the check in agent went to consult with her manager who then confirmed that we would have to pay to check in our baggage. We have no option but to pay this charge however as a result of this delay at check in arrived at the gate to find that our flight had closed. As this was the last flight of the day we were forced to find expensive overnight hotel accommodation. I tried contact BA Customer Services after this incident on numerous occasion however they didn’t bothered to respond. At the 3rd attempt, after I cc the CEO on my complaint I got a one line response saying that there was no free baggage included with our ticket. At this point I got my solicitor to write a letter and they finally agreed to refund my baggage charge. However they are refusing to compensate me for the missed flight and the considerable expenses and loss that I incurred as a result of their mistake.\n",

Old style ying yang business class with total lack of storage space, and the 777 was showing it’s age. However we were told the aircraft was being taken out of service the following week to be upgraded to the new club suites. The cabin crew were good, food ok, wines a little disappointing. Overall a decent flight.\n",

Our flight was delayed overnight, our connecting flight was missed, the overall delay resulted in more than 48 hours. Rechecking our bags took 4 hours standing in line.

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  Check in easy at BGI due to us checking flightradar24 and finding the flight was delayed by nearly 2 hours, no notification from the airlines so other passengers arrived earlier. Easy boarding in sequence numbers. Seat is a joke for 8 hour flight, no leg room on isle seat of 4, the seat in front frame blocks you stretching your legs and once the passenger in front reclines its even worse. Food is mediocre with poor choice and all of the drink choices had run out before the stewardess had arrived to my seat (only choice Coca-Cola, water or red wine. The connecting flight from LHR - MAN was cancelled with no contact from the airline, I only found out trying to book a seat on the return legs, with no alternative flight provided. We had to privately book a taxi from LHR to Manchester for 4 persons as this worked out cheaper than the train. The outbound flight was also a farce, no mention of Terminal change at LHR from 5 to 3, so quick turnaround changing terminals was chaotic and stressful for older relatives travelling with us. Overall shocking from British Airways and can guarantee I will never use them again.\n",

      "Review: Not Verified |  British Airways - Travel with Confidence. Probably the most unsuitable tag line, they should be ashamed. Back in October I booked a holiday to Punta Cana with BA only to have it cancelled early in 2022. Late last year I also booked Heathrow to Malaga for a family wedding in May. Guess what, a few weeks ago that also got cancelled. I had the chance to rebook with BA but with so many cancellations planned I was not willing to take the risk of not making my destination for such an important event, so applied for and received a refund. I have now also asked for my Executive Club account to be closed as I shall no longer be wasting my time booking with such a shambles of an airline. My suggestion is if you want to 'travel with confidence' choose another airline. Any airline.\n",

      "Review: Not Verified |  I have been battling a long overdue refund with BA regarding a flight originally booked in 2019... The flight was cancelled, a voucher was issued, another flight was booked using this voucher, and then again cancelled. After trying to use the voucher for a new flight, BA kept advising I couldn't as the voucher had been used. I asked them to check the status of that flight (as it never left) and the agent advised she didn't have access to that information. Two years in, I managed to speak to someone who recognised that either a voucher or refund was due and made a note on my record. I then decided to pursue a refund, as felt this would be less problematic. BA have acknowledged they owe me a refund. One phone call they said it will be with me in 18 working days. I then chased when it was long overdue. I was then told it will be with me in 21 working days. The refund never came. I try regularly to get through to Customer Service for the automated system to advise no agents are available. I have also sent two follow up messages via the case reference link they sent me, requesting an update, but with no response. Honestly feel very let down by BA who up until this, I felt were the more trustworthy and reliable airline. I suspect they will have ruined many trusted relationships with customers by now.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  When I tried to check in, they required a certificate of insurance for Covid travel, but I did not have it, I tried for over 2 hours to get it issued, but my bank (where I had the travel insurance) the department that could issue the certificate was closed, it was 18:30. After a very long time, I got a cover letter which the bank sent to me, but then to be told I had missed the check in by 2 minutes. They would not let me board, and I missed the flight. So I contacted BA, and tried to rebook another departure flight, only to be told that because I missed my departing flight, my return flight had automatically been cancelled and this was BA policy. So then they worked out a new price to book the flights, but now the price was £3500. I originally paid £1500 for the flights. I then did a search on Google and found flights for £1100, flying out with Air Mauritius and returning with BA on the same flight I was originally supposed to return on. Unfortunately BA had made me miss 2 days of my holiday, I searched for over an hour but could not find anywhere on BA site that I needed the Insurance document. When I checked in for the Mauritius airways flight, they did not ask for the insurance document, and I had a lovely flight with no issues. Every time I fly with BA, I have a bad experience and I promise I will never fly with them again. \n",

Upon check-in, my expensive upgrade had been given away to someone else, and I was left to choose a miserable middle seat near the toilet. I spent an entire afternoon calling customer service. If my call went through at all (the automated system simply hangs up when it decides they are too busy) I was placed on indefinite hold, replete with elevator music and an insincere guarantee that my call mattered. I was greeted by someone with a heavy accent, over a very low quality, hard to hear line (I am 32 and not deaf). Sometimes, they would purposely hang up before I said anything. Other times, they would purposely hang up after I stated my plight. IF I managed to persist through all of that, for hours on end, they would hang up purposely after \"needing\" to put me on hold once more to \"speak with their supervisor.\" In the end, BA managed to swindle me for hundreds of dollars, and I booked with another airline on principle. \n",

Having paid almost £1K extra to change our return flight for the family, to get a flight at a specific time, BA cancelled this and placed us on another flight almost 10 hours later. There was no option to get any of the other available flights. The business class lounge at LHR was packed with hardly any space to move. The aircraft was filthy with food wrapping papers on my seat and floor. The seats were uncomfortable. Food for business class passengers included bread rolls passed in a basket.

However that was seven weeks ago and no Avios points have been added to my account, I have called their call centre multiple times at one point being put on hold for an hour to put through to the right department, when the phone was answered I was told it was the wrong department and to phone a number which was read out to me which was the same number I was calling! This scenario has replayed itself probably about twenty times now, it is clear that BA have no intention of resolving this and are just making their customer go round in circles before they give up, This airline is absolutely appalling in the way it treats its customers.\n",

Food can best be described as wholesome, but not meeting quality levels of Air France, Swiss or Lufthansa short haul business class meals. Menu is still missing, and like many other aspects of the experience, BA cut a lot during Covid and have not reintroduced. I wouldn't mind, but on European trips in 2022, BA are charging up to 3 times the fare levels of 2019, and the overall value for money is now very poor. The WiFi did not work from start to finish of the flight. Crew said it had worked on the way out and the Captain had contacted London to get it fixed on the return.

My flight to Paris was no exception. Not only was the flight late, overcrowded and not managed at all by disinterested staff - that we sat on the tarmac, full boarded for one hour while we waited for catering to be loaded on (front and then back) left me gobsmacked. As they barely offer any food service anyway (small packet of crisps and an even smaller bottle of water) on a 45 minute flight, I wondered why they thought it was good operational planning to delay a whole plane load of passengers so that 6 people in business class could speedily eat a poor quality meal on the flight to Paris. As it transpired I was over 90 minutes late and missed the meeting I was flying to Paris to attend. Never again.\n",

      "Review: Not Verified |  Feb 25, 2022. We show up at the airport 3 hours early for our flight to Dublin. we waited in line for 3+ hours to just check in our luggage. After that, we learn our flight is delayed another 3+ hours. We had a connecting flight in London. When trying to go through customs they wouldn't let us through because the boarding of the plane was going to be happening in 30 minutes. They told us to wait in a customer service line that was well over an hour. We then found out we could have gone through customs because the connecting flight from London to Dublin was delayed over an hour. However, by the time we were told this information, the doors were about to close. The next available flight to Dublin was 2/27 late evening. With that being said we were forced to stay the night in London. After talking to a British Airways manager, they informed us that BA would reimburse us for any hotel, flight (to get to Dublin regardless of the airline), clothes (due to them losing our bags), excursions and transportation. Due to this issue, we had to spend multiple days shopping for clothes, lost out on days we had booked to explore the country, had to now buy an extra suitcase for the new clothes we received (went 4 days with lost bags). When we finally got home, we submitted our claims like we were told to do. Within a few days, it's declined. We have asked for a contact # just to talk to somebody, again declined. We tried to reach out via social media and we get passive-aggressive messages.  They refuse to pay me back for the new flight to get to Dublin, transportation to and from the airport in London, the hotel for London, the clothes I had to buy because they lost my bags for 4 days, and the extra luggage fee because of the extra clothes I had to buy. There is no customer support and they are impossible to get a direct response from.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways are in the process of upgrading all its 777 fleet to the new Club Suite, but BA59 had the 16-yrs-old, packed-like-sardines Club World product. The lounge at CPT was also bursting at the seams and food orders were so behind that many passengers had left by the time their food arrived. On boarding, we were surprised to find that the menu, amenity kit and bottle of water had already been placed in the storage drawer. We suspect this is another cynical time-saving initiative on the part of BA. Frustratingly, the menu turned out to be incorrect and the replacement dishes were probably the worst we have ever encountered in any business class on any airline. The drinks run was cancelled without any warning on the spurious basis of a passenger with a nut allergy. It's hard to avoid suspicions that cabin crew were being economical with the truth. Apart from a rather turbulent ride, the flight was otherwise uneventful and arrival was slightly ahead of schedule. Baggage handling was, however, atrociously slow.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  We flew to Funchal, Madeira yesterday. Madeira has no COVID restrictions for entry, yet BA asked us to upload our NHS vaccination passes, before we could check in online. I received an OK about an hour later, but my husband did not, so I couldn’t check in online. We arrive at Heathrow 2 hours before departure and stood in a long queue for check in. There were just 3 desks open for a queue of approx 100 travellers. Then several people went on breaks or disappeared so we were down to one desk open, with the queue barely moving. I went to complain to various BA staff, who said the manager had been told and more people were coming. One blonde lady walked around for ages, shepherding travellers into the queue, before sitting down at a desk. Another man later did likewise, making us wonder why they hadn’t simply worked at the desks from the beginning. All in all we stood in that queue for a good hour, before almost running to the security queue, which thankfully moved quickly. Then we hurriedly bought a sandwich, walked to our departure gate and stood on the bus to the plane. The whole experience was extremely stressful; and took the best part of 2 hours. We did not have time to sit down until we did so on the plane. And completely unnecessary! If we had been able to check in online, this would not have happened. My husband’s vaccination pass is fine, but not required for Madeira. I think it is a systems failure as he received an email yesterday morning saying his pass was not in order, as did I, even though I’d previously been told, I could check in online. Also unnecessary as if BA had staffed the desks properly the queue would have moved. A staff member told us BA had laid off lots of staff during lock down and was now begging them to return, but having been treated badly, they didn’t want to. The flight itself was fine, on time. We were given a bag of crisps and a bottle of water, again fine, nothing praise worthy.\n",

But disappointment became desperation as we had not eaten anything since Dublin that morning at 7am. We had no time to eat at LHR so thought we'll get something usually around 1 hour into the flight. 3.5 hours after take off they served out food. Food was fine but nothing special, no issues with beverage, no attention to kids as you'd expect from many other airlines, even a kids book would be good. Movies are all outdated and already watched. So overall very medium experience.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified | One would think that the number of crises BA incurs they would have had emergency planning down to a fine art. I last flew with BA May 2017 - yes, the weekend of the last but one IT crisis. I swore never again but ended up purchasing a ticket Aug 2018 to Bologna - BA cancelled the flight. Then covid hit so ended up with a voucher. Fast forward to Feb 26th, 2022. Received a message 5.30am 30mins from LHR that that my flight was cancelled. Arrived at the airport with everyone else just wandering and seeking answers. The staff that were there either told you to go online - a bit difficult as the BA systems were down or ring BA. Ha Ha or go home - not very helpful if you live two hours from LHR. By some miracle the app sprung into life, and I managed to get one of the last 10 seats on the evening flight. Sat in arrivals as there was a coffee shop - soon ran out of seats. By 12.00 midday most of us were trying to get airside to use lounges but no one was allowed in departures until two hours prior to your flight supposedly because of crowds. Pointed out BA should have provided refreshments - told to put a claim in. Eventually got to departures and made it through security. BA customer services (note the oxymoron) - had a consistent queue of about 20 people as BA were still cancelling/rearranging flights for passengers who were airside. Boarded flight 45mins late. Sat on tarmac as the pilot told us the delay was them trying to 'reconcile' luggage. When we took off given one very small bottle of water and a cereal bar for a five-hour flight They purport to be a top-class airline but in fact Ryanair has more finesse. The staff are fine but can be miserable because they are treated so badly and like to remind you that they are doing their best in a difficult situation - well so are the passengers. The aircraft are cramped and worn. I had been reluctant to use Egyptair but flew home with them on a new aircraft with a very good entertainment system and was provided with a hot meal and snack for same price as a BA ticket. How on earth can BA justify their prices? The management should be sacked as ultimately they are to blame for the ruination of this airline.\n",

The aircraft was better than the outbound flight, who screen was so small. After serving only about 2/3rd of the cabin, no first choice. Only a vegetarian dish or a chicken dish from the economy cabin. The airline must know that vegetarians will order a meal, so why include it as a choice. Also, to offer a roll of ham/cheese for breakfast after a 12 hour flight is cost saving. A hot breakfast should be offered. With only 90 minutes between my connecting flight, due to late arrival, I made staff aware. Whilst they let me and others passengers of the flight first, there was no staff to assist in getting us to our flight. It was a struggle to get my connecting flight. On arriving in Glasgow, got txt to say my bags did not make the flight. First time using BA premium and likely my last.\n",

This was long after the meal / drinks service had been cleared, and remained like that as we landed and deplaned.

You could not rebook via BA’s website. Instead passengers were compelled to queue at Gate A17 at LHR to possibly rebook and be provided with accommodation overnight.

      "Review: Not Verified |  Utterly appalling company. We've flown with them two times now, and both times it's been a disaster. The first time: Return flight was delayed by over 24 hours. There was nobody at the gate to tell us this, so a large group of passengers had to roam round Dubai airport looking for BA staff. There were none. Eventually another airline told us to go down some unmarked stairs, where a very angry person told us it was our fault, and we should have been given a letter. We had no letter. They then put us on a bus to the other terminal. When we arrived, there was nobody to greet us. We were literally just left there. We had to, yet again, contact another airline, who managed to find us transport to the hotel. When we got there, we were told it was full and we couldn't choose our rooms. We were given a terrible, dirty, cramped room. Several times throughout the night we were called to tell us our flight had been moved. Eventually we got to board the next day. My tray table was broken, as was the window blind, and I didn't get a meal. No compensation was offered. The second time I need to reschedule my flight. The website assured me this was fine, but provided no link. I needed to phone up. If you need to phone BA, don't even bother trying. I never got to speak to anyone, and just ended up booking a hotel to wait for my flight rather than rescheduling. The food has been terrible, meagre portions given infrequently. My sandwich was inedible. \r\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  Return trip Cape Town to Durban in Club Class highlighted the inconsistency. Our outbound trip in December was good in all respects, whereas the return trip was disappointing. Check in was fine, apart from the agent failing to label one of bags priority, resulting in a long wait for our third bag. The lounge was busy, but no complaints. We went to the boarding gate at the check in time indicated on the screen, where there was no sign of activity, although the screen was still showing the same gate and departure time. Shortly thereafter two ground staff appeared and when approached said the flight was delayed from 1330 to 1410 and the gate was changed to the lower level bus gates. The informational screens had now updated to the delayed time and new gate. I checked on the flight radar app, which showed that our aircraft had started in Durban, and flown to Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, back to Cape Town, and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight. In fact looking at its schedule and turn around times it was always going to be late. Boarding eventually started at 1400 with departure at 1430, 60 minutes late. Drinks service only started 30 minutes later, followed by lunch. The food was good but the wine offering very mediocre, and not up to club standards. With the price of good wines in South Africa there is no excuse for serving poor wine. Lunch service was quick, but then the crew disappeared behind the curtain and there was no offering of top up drinks unless specifically requested. Overall this was a disappointing flight with a lacklustre crew\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  I recently had the unfortunate privilege of travelling on British Airways from Detroit to Bangalore and back. Given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layovers, I decided to spend extra and get a business class ticket. I was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that I was special because I spent that extra money or was in Business class. From shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff, I experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeys. The trump was being stranded in London having missed my connection and spending close to 3 hours to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flight. Being a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turn. Some special passengers were escorted to the Club World check in. When we asked the lady, she told us to continue standing where we were and she would come back to get us when the counter freed up. Needless to say it never did. Finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked. So I come back to the question: Can big corporations lie with no accountability? Why would I spend my hard-earned money on something that gave me nothing extra? Shame on you British Airways for your complete disregard for your passengers. Stop your lying or update your promises!\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  In Glasgow one check in desk open. Huge queue with no business check in. It took me close to an hour to bagdrop. Getting onto the aircraft in Glasgow, no hello from the crew and the same getting off.  I normally find BA cabin crew very nice. Breakfast was a very tired looking croissant.  I used the BA lounge in Terminal 3. Not very keen on the new table service. Poor choice and miniscule portions. Lounge staff were very nice in both directions. On arrival at LHR there was a coach transfer from T5 to T3. We were packed in like sardines. So much for social distancing. The flight from LHR to Pisa was delayed and once we boarded we sat on the aircraft for another 2hrs 30 mins. Captain advised us that there was no tow truck for push back and when it did eventually arrive there were no baggage handlers to load the containers. No drinks or anything offered while we waited. Food was not even worth mentioning. As far as Club Europe goes it's not worth the extra cost. No priority baggage as mine were last onto the belt in Pisa, seats are economy seats with the centre one blocked off. The first officer summed it up when we arrived in Pisa- Sorry folks this trip was a pretty poor show by BA, and he was right. For the return trip on Hogmanay we left on time. I've never been on a flight to or from Pisa which has left in time. Pisa lounge is nice enough but the food choice is laughable. On board I gave the food a miss.  Heathrow back to Glasgow Flight left on time. Food was an antipasto of some sort which I declined.  Both cases were last off again. Club Europe is really not worth the money as you are in an economy cabin. I would have thought that BA would do more about their food and onboard service since the cabin is what it is.\n",

There is no inflight screen no overhead screen. Although the curtain was closed economy people used the forward bathroom with no crew sending them back. The only salvation was a pretty decent shepherds pie and red wine otherwise I would avoid flying BA.

That did not meet my needs so I requested cancellation and to get my bags back, I was told to cancel my booking on the BA APP, they could not do it at the desk. I was then directed via a gate to collect my bags, this meant having to go via the UK border to reach a baggage belt, then I waited for my bags for 3 hours because they had automatically stored my bags for the following days flight.

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  I had a future travel voucher for Singapore to London which I thought would be perfect for my flight to relocate home. I'd been under the impression that it was a simple process - just call up and book onto the same route that I'd previously paid for (and that had previously been cancelled by BA themselves) - but on a new date. How wrong I was. First, I had to pay to top up my flight - a significant amount, equivalent to around the value of my original flight which was a redemption ticket of part cash part airmiles. This was because of price increases and the fact that I was flying at peak times. The extra charge also meant that I overall paid more than face value (their online price at the time for the ticket) for the flight, as well as them still keeping the airlines I'd redeemed. They explained that the online price and redemption prices differ and that's just how the system works. However, if I had taken a refund I would have lost a lot of money to administration fees. They had me in a desperate situation where I was losing hundreds of pounds to them no matter what I did, so I cut my losses and booked the flight. Or at least I thought I did. The call centre agent - who had previously explained she was working remotely with no manager or supervision (and no way to escalate issues) - took my card details (including full card number, dates, and CVC code) - and explained my flight ticket and receipt for payment for an extra bag would follow. A week later, I still had no ticket, no details, no charge to my card, no booking reference - nothing. I called up to confirm. The call centre agent I reached apologised and advised he would escalate it to the bookings team and again took my card details. Once again, I waited another week, and sign of being booked onto a flight. Thus began a cycle of increasingly frequent and desperate calls to British Airways as they repeatedly failed to do the simple task of booking me on a flight, spanning over 6 weeks.  On the Friday before my Monday flight, I sat in tears to another BA call centre agent who promised to get me on my flight and book my extra bag. The next day - around 48 hours before I was due to fly, I finally got my booking reference yet they still failed to charge me for or add on my extra bag. Luckily, I noticed this on my check in details and managed to add a bag online. The whole experience was stressful, costly, and resulted in me spending hours and days on the phone listening to British Airways hold music. Furthermore, there has been a significant cutback to BAs inflight catering service due to COVID, resulting in smaller portions, leaving me quite hungry on such a long flight. Though I've flown BA repeatedly with few problems in the past, their service has gone significantly downhill.\n",

The return journey was a shambles and more delays finally arriving back at Manchester completely exhausted and needing another holiday. There is light at the end of this horrid tunnel Virgin Atlantic have just started the same route from this month. Now we all know this is a better option.\n",

      "Review: Not Verified |  What has happened to British Airways? The whole pre-flight experience now is prehistoric, they appear to have gone back to the 80’s and now make passengers physically queue to manually check in adding hours to the journey not to mention how ridiculous it is to bunch people together in a big slow queue. On the premise it’s due to covid precautions! They are the only airline making passengers do this and they can’t even open all the desks so for 200 passengers they had two check in staff, like the post office in 1980! Apart from the aircraft and cabin crew literally everything else about this airline has disintegrated to the point where they’re just not reliable enough to use for business purposes and their attitude towards exec club members and other loyal customers is a disgrace. I’ve chosen and insisted upon BA for business and personal travel for decades and accumulated a lot of air miles, I also have not one but two BA Amex companion vouchers that cost me 40k of spending to earn so that tells you how much I’ve supported this airline despite their shocking decline in recent years. In the last year I’ve booked 6 BA flights, 1 personal and 5 business flights for me and two colleagues but after taking my money and wasting my time planning the itineraries, 5 of the 6 have been cancelled forcing me to tear up my plans and pay double for last minute alternatives with other airlines, the personal one to St Lucia they cancelled my return 2 days after flying me out forcing me to cancel my holiday and fly back immediately or risk being stuck there for 6 weeks. That cost me my £2500 holiday and they offered nothing by way of compensation! A couple of weeks ago I noticed that one of my Amex companion vouchers was apparently going to expire on Nov 12th this year so I tried to speak to them. As the World has largely been closed since March 20 I assumed it would be straightforward to extend the voucher to a time there are holiday destinations properly open, not to mention my experiences dealing with routinely cancelled flights and my reluctance to risk a third person on another holiday, but after 2 days going around in circles speaking really bad English to people who have no empathy for me or even live in the same country I finally got through to someone at BA who told me that no they won’t extend the voucher! I’m even a shareholder but after this level of treatment and disrespect I will not spend another penny with this airline, I’m not even going to bother using my second voucher and I’ve cancelled my BA Amex. I work in the music business managing tours for bands so I reckon I book 1000 flights a year and my only satisfaction is knowing their attitude has cost them that! Roll on the inevitable BA administration but at least somebody else can buy it for cheap and start rebuilding what was once the Worlds Favourite Airline but now the most ridiculed. Who’d have thought BA could ever make Ryanair look like an attractive option.\n",

      "Review: Not Verified |  I booked and paid for what I thought was a business class seat on a flight to Athens. What I got was a premium economy seat. The first nine rows were business class seats, rows 10 to 16 were what should have been the premium economy cabin (but had been added to the business class section) which had less comfortable seats that didn’t fully recline, unlike the seats in rows 1 to 9 (I was in row 11). This is not a case of me being snobby, but simply a point of principle and a clear case of BA mis-selling. Had I known prior that I would be paying the same business class price but for seats that were less comfortable than other business class passengers on the same flight, I wouldn’t have booked. I complained on board along with several other passengers who also resented being scammed in that way. I also made a formal complaint to BA but was fobbed off.

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified | This was my first flight during the pandemic, so it was understandable the difficulties facing airlines. Check-in was longer than normal due to the vaccine checks and passenger locator forms etc. But on the return flight, it was a total mess. Just two counters open for economy and one for business. There were arguments regarding vaccine checks, where two BA staff were contradicting each other. It took an hour and ten minutes just to check in, resulting in the flight delay. On board, I was not expecting great service.  Seating was extremely uncomfortable, 29 inch pitch and 17 inch wide seats - just about bearable for an hour and a half flight.  On board service was a packet of crisps and a small bottle of water from another, no eye contact with me just handed out. However, I was pleased that disembarking passengers were let out in groups, despite a few idiots who decided to stand a up to get their hand luggage out while the aircraft is was still taxing to the gate. The cabin crew did manage to force them back to their seats and close the lockers.\n",

On arrival at Heathrow to check in, the British Airways staff informed me that I had booked both flight seats in my name by mistake. I offered to pay a fee to get the second seat changed to my sister's name but British Airways refused us to board and sent us home. However, the staff member who I spoke to at the desk promised to email us flight vouchers which I would get shortly so that I could fly at another time with BA since they do not offer refunds. I never received these flight vouchers. I have chased numerous times on the phone with BA staff who said that it was my error and that no flight vouchers would be sent to me. They have no record that a staff member spoke to me and promised these vouchers, they say I was just a 'no show' which is inaccurate. I have sent numerous emails to BA explaining what happened and asking form my promised vouchers. I have had no response to my emails/messages. One BA staff member on the phone said that I should track down the lady I spoke to at Heathrow and ask her if she remembers me.

The crew never even had the decency to speak to us to apologise in person or even over the tannoy.

We booked an easyJet flight from Gatwick instead and had to pay to get ourselves to Gatwick. A complaint was registered several weeks ago with no response so far. Perhaps BA have a backlog of complaints the way they are performing at the moment. It’s an embarrassment that our national flag carrier is being comfortably out performed by budget airlines but that appears to be the case at the moment.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  I think British Airways needs to be much clearer about what their Covid-19 \"travel flexibility\" really means, because it doesn't pass the common-sense test: I purchased a round-trip business class ticket from New York to-and-from Mykonos through London. I traveled there with no problem. The day before my return to New York, though, I took my Covid-19 test and learned that I tested positive. I tried to call the airline on the many usless numbers they provide on their website. The recorded message drones on and on about how they have no one to answer the phone because of Covid safety and simply says \"therefore we can't answer your call; try again.\" No ability to leave a call-back number or a voicemail, etc. For whatever reason the BA website thought that I had bought the ticket through a third-party agent (I did not - I bought it on BA.com) and so wouldnt let me cancel or reschedule the flight on the web site. I called and called over the coming days and could not get through to the London, Athens or New York lines. Two days later after having 2 negative PCR tests (the most accurate test), I learned I was not positive and so had to buy a new $5000 return flight to the U.S. I've now been calling the BA USA customer service line for nearly a month at least every other day, never to get through. Finally did and have been told that the fact that I couldnt get on the flight because of a COVID scare counts for nothing. The fact they dont have enough people answering the phone counts for nothing. Or that I was unable to change the flight to a few days later on the web site becuase the ticket was mis-booked. They have offered that if I send them a Greek doctor's note saying that I was sick, then they'll give me a voucher for a future flight from Mykonos to New York. I am speechless at the stupidity of this whole situation. \n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  My flight from Boston to Heathrow arrived in time, but I and other passengers were not allowed to disembark the plane. We were kept in the tarmac for one hour and a half without being given sufficient information about what was causing this delay. Because of this delay, I and other passengers lost the connecting flight to Tirana. I was offered another connecting flight which was 8 hours later from the time of arrival. When I booked this flight, one of the main reasons that made me choose it was the fact that the layover was a little bit more than an hour. Turning it into an 8 hour layover I think is unacceptable and very poor customer service. It shows lack of respect for your clients and lack of commitment by this company to provide to their customers what they were promised and what they paid for.

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified | Year after year the British Airways (BA) service on the same route (Washington-London) is becoming worse. We just had one bad experience after another on this route in July 2021.  British Airways (BA) notified us that our connection flight to Nice was bumped from 2pm to 6pm so we had to spend an extra 4 hours in the airport during this COVID era. Their website and emails prior to our day of flight kept asking us to check UK.gov for the COVID rules and regulations for transit through London which said that no COVID test was necessary if we could show proof of vaccine, however upon our arrival at the airport they told us we needed to go to the basement to take a COVID test to show negative results. They charged us $250 per person for a rapid COVID test which was an outrage and totally unnecessary. We could have gotten the test done at a cheaper rate had we known that this was a requirement prior to our flight. Food service was horrible (they served food with lots of cheese to me while I had requested a vegan meal due to may dairy allergies). BA damaged our Samsonite luggage and they told us at the airport that we needed to report this online. We have been trying to resolve this issue since July and after asking us for photos like 10 times, they are still giving us the run around. \n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  I’ve been flying with BA for years and never had any issues. I recently had to arrange to have surgery in Budapest and naturally wanted to fly BA. So I booked my flights from BHD to BUD via LHR online on their site. Once booked I informed the hospital and confirmed my appointment. The very next day I received an email from BA telling me they had cancelled my flight to BUD but not to worry as they had moved me to an earlier (a much earlier) flight the same day. Only problem was this earlier flight departed around two hours before my flight from BHD arrived. I would have thought that this would have flashed up on their system as being an issue, but seemingly not… *interlude* To get into Hungary during covid one needs a valid reason, with medical treatment being one. I had to fill in a very confusing form on the Hungarian police website that was a confusing mix of Hungarian and pidgin English. Anyway form filled in with flight numbers etc, emailed to the authorities there and exemption granted. So I took the earlier flight but this meant I had to fly into London the previous evening and stay overnight in a hotel. So operation booked, hotel booked, airport transfers booked immigration papers amended and re sent and admiration granted and flights re booked, what could go wrong? Around three weeks before I was due to travel, BA, rather unsportingly, decided to cancel my flight to BUD again. Needless to say I was furious. I complained to BA customer services and was given a stock excuse about covid disrupting air travel. Great excuse, only having looked at BUD arrivals info, Ryanair had been flying there once daily for at least the preceding several months. So BA’s covid excuse rang somewhat hollow. Epilogue: I got refunded most of my money from the flights I booked with BA, although they refused to refund my BHD - LHR flights because who knows? I also lost the money I had spent on a hotel and half of the money I had spent on booking airport transfers. Given the cavalier attitude BA seem to have to bookings and their indifference to ruining weeks of preparation on my part and the fact that I lost a not inconsiderable sum of money, I’ve decided to avoid BA from now on.\n",

Note that BA actually charges for seat pre-selection in biz class -- 100 UK pounds in this case! Does any other airline in the world dare do that? I saved the money and waited until checkin to choose my seat for free. The seats were BA's universally derided, cramped 6-across back-to-front configuration, where you stare into the face of your seat mate an arm's length away. No other airline ever came up with this awkward arrangement --- I wonder why? No preflight drink was offered. At meal time I selected one of the three main offerings, only to be told it wasn't available -- even though there were only 3 people in my 16 seat biz section. The seat area has practically no storage except a tiny drawer at ankle level that is inaccessible when the seat is in lie flat position. The \"bed\" is the narrowest I have experienced in biz class, and is also very hard. The cabin was very cold and the blanket very thin; I had to raid blankets from two other seats just to stay warm. The amenity kit is the smallest I've ever seen in biz class -- it fits in the palm of the hand. All in all, this uncomfortable, miserly experience is hardly worth the £5,727 that BA charges for this route. I used miles to pay for my ticket -- but of course got whacked with BA's unique and notorious \"fuel surcharge\" fee of $636 for using miles.\n",

Fully aware of the covid safety restrictions at the moment, which the staff do an admirable job with - but nevertheless a lot to say on the state of BA First at the moment. Firstly - no lounge at all at Mexico City Terminal 2. There's a paid lounge, but the check in staff wouldn't help with the details. Mexico City Terminal 1 has functional lounges for AeroMexico working. Not good enough for an expensive ticket. Finally got to board and the staff are incredible - but throughout they were super apologetic as to what was to come. The food was literally inedible in First and staff offered commented as much every time. So for an 11 hour trip in First the option really was chocolate or crisps. The first suite on the flight had visible signs of wear and tear and needs some attention. The seat would not easily convert to a bed. It had scuff marks around it and generally looked a bit shabby. Again, not what you'd expect from a premium product. I left my watch on the flight in error and contacted BA immediately about this. Despite assurances that they have a comprehensive cleaning process during Covid my watch was never found. BA has outsourced their lost and found service to a separate company and in the process they have completely washed their hands on helping out customers. Given that I told them specifically where I'd left the watch I can only assume that one of the cleaning staff decided to keep it. All in all, you pay premium on a flight for additional service. BA isn't offering it at the moment. If it is essential that you have to fly really don't bother with first unless you have to - or go to another airline. The company just don't care.\n",

On way back not a single maskless or incorrectly worn mask challenged. A guy opposite me had his mask below nose the whole flight. He had a conversation with several attendants neither of whom said anything.  Not like the crew were busy either, did 2 services the whole flight then rest of the time didn’t see them.

I do not know which is more shocking that BA would lie to the authorities in order to support their indefensible position or that their agents do not know how to read a passenger name record's air history.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  I was deeply unimpressed with the lack of social distancing on my flight. The plane to London was 90% or more full, and no social distancing could be applied. A number of people wearing face masks incorrectly (over mouth or as a chinstrap) throughout the flight, and there was a fair amount of time when masks were off for the free snack (small bag of crisps and 250ml of water).  It seems crazy to allow a considerate amount of time with masks off or inappropriately worn in such a small space with no safe distance whatsoever. Also, only the absolute minimum of service which, given COVID, is understandable but makes the flight really boring - or not, since some excitement was provided by turbulence, with very little information from the flight deck. Disembarkation was chaotic to say the least but Terminal 5 was empty and vast enough to allow to finally distance. An upgrade for 89 Euros one was was available but it didn't seem to make sense. At least they departed on time and the plane appeared reasonably clean.\n",

I've reached out to executives after trying the usual customer service path. Nothing has worked. They will not call me and will not provide me any resolution. They are blatantly ignoring emails asking for help. Avoid British Airways. Service is non-existent and they will keep your money. They are keeping almost $3000US of our money.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  London to Frankfurt. I made the mistake of exchanging my April flights with BA for a voucher, because of the travel disruption due to the pandemic. Big mistake. BA has failed completely and does not seem to care. I tried to book an August flight using the voucher, but frlights cannot be booked online using a voucher. You have to wait for hours on the phone to speak to someone. Customer service tried to charge me twice the original cost. Then no email confirmation for hours, after I chased it up (another long wait on hold). Email confirmation showed they had booked the wrong outbound date - service supervisor denied any error on their part and refused to rebook for correct date or give a refund. A few days later I started all over again and booked an alternative outbound date (still not the one I wanted, but better) - And 3 weeks later, BA cancelled the return flight! So I Called for a refund to be told \"If it hasn't appeared in my account after 21 days, to get back in touch\".  Things go wrong. It's how you deal with problems that mark out good customer service. BA hasn't a clue!\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified | BA cancelled my flight to Lyon, March/April 2020, because of the Corona crisis. I could not obtain a refund, as the BA website and telephone service made this impossible, it just sent me round in circles. So I opted for a Future Travel Voucher, as this could be obtained via the website. I have now tried to use the voucher for a flight to Munich, and was informed by the website that I have to call BA for this. The Silver card member phone number is inaccessible, as BA has reduced telephone access to one number. I have now called this number five times, each time I was told to call at another time, as 'in these difficult times, they had to protect staff'. This is exactly the same message that I received the many times I called for a refund. Is BA not honouring their voucher system, trying to fob off customers and keep their money? This is appalling business practice!\n",

      "Review: Not Verified |  I booked flights to Rome from the US and then home through London to LAX in February of this year for the 1st of August. I booked through American Airlines, and then I paid for seat selection for 3 people through the BA website, paying US $951 in total. With the pandemic, it is now impossible for me and my group to travel to Italy and England on this trip as (1) we are not allowed to travel outside the US, (2) as Americans we are not allowed to travel to Italy or England, and (3) the US government has not processed one of the passport renewal we need to fly which was mailed in early February. I had to cancel all of our hotels, AirB&Bs, car and train reservations over the last week in order to qualify to obtain refunds and/or vouchers. I’ve tried to reach British Airways customer service a number of times, finally got through today after an hour on hold. I asked how to obtain a refund or voucher for the business class seat selection that I had paid for and was told that I will lose the money I paid, that there are no refunds or vouchers allowed, because I booked the trip through American Airlines and not through British Airways. My understanding is that BA and AA have a partnership that should make it relatively seamless to book and travel on either or both partners, though I was shocked at having to pay nearly $1000 just to reserve our seats in business class, but this is apparently not the case. I was told that if BA cancels the two flights that we are booked on that I might be able to get either a voucher or a refund. I was prepared today to accept a voucher that I could use when I rebook this trip for 2021, as I understand that BA (and all airlines) are suffering financially as much as I am, but I was not prepared to be totally ripped off by BA. I cannot wait until the first flight is supposed to fly, August 1st, to cancel this as I will lose the money and miles I paid American Airlines for this flight. I am at a loss as to what I can do to handle a situation that is totally out of my control and for which an airline partner that I valued traveling on is refusing to offer a voucher or a refund. I will never again do anything that gives revenue to British Airways.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  I booked a trip to Spain for mid-March 2020 with American Airlines, British Airways and Iberia. I needed to cancel this flight due to the pandemic and travel ban to Europe that began in March. I was able to change my flight at no cost, which is great, but given the fact that my flight left the day the travel ban began, those tickets should have been refunded. If I were to have boarded that flight, I would have been quarantined in Europe and would have faced a mandatory quarantine upon re-entry to the US IF I were able to return at all. The fact that British Airways did not cancel this flight is beyond me since I do not know who in their right mind would have traveled to Spain with the travel ban enforced. The response I received from British Airways is that it does not matter the reason, unless they cancel the flight, no refund or voucher is available. I'm very disappointed in the response from them during a global pandemic and will not book another flight with them.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  I flew with BA recently from Sydney to London, deciding to return back home from travelling due to the coronavirus situation. The first ticket I booked with them was via Hong Kong. After booking, HK closed it's borders so I could no longer get this flight. I rang up BA who advised that the HK flight was not yet cancelled on the system so they couldn't yet book me onto a new flight yet. The customer service agent assured me he would ring me back at 11am the next day as it would be cancelled on the system by then and he would tell me what flight BA would be putting me on as a replacement. 11am came and went the next day and I had not received a phone call. I tried ringing to find out what was going on and was on hold for 5 hours and still no one answered! I decided to book myself onto another flight as there were hardly any left available and I didn't want to end up stuck in Australia. I had not received the promised phone call or even an email to tell me what my replacement flight would be so felt I had no other choice. When I got back home I raised this with BA. They told me that I was supposed to process an 'involuntary change' to get a replacement flight - that is not what the customer agent advised me! I'd never even heard that term before. He simply said BA would sort it out and put me on a replacement flight, he didn't say I had to do anything. So now because I was given the incorrect advice, I am out of pocket by a considerable amount. I raised it with the BA complaints team that I had been advised incorrectly and if I had been told I needed to do an involuntary change myself I would have done so. They were extremely unhelpful and just said that they don't know why I was advised incorrectly and there is nothing they can do about it. When I said that wasn't good enough they basically just fobbed me off and told me to go to a third party adjudicator if I wanted but they were not prepared to do anything.  I will never use this airline again.\n",

They cancelled my flight but they weren't honest about what they had done and lied. They claimed that I could re-book and showed lots of flights - none were in fact scheduled to fly but BA claimed that they were full. Then my return booking completely disappeared and the website claimed that \"all journeys complete\". Website at no point gave any indication about how difficult it was getting to fly from the USA to UK. Impossible to get through to BA in London. USA BA much better - a total wait of 1 hour 40 minutes to make 2 calls. Staff at the call centre efficient and helpful. Chaos at Chicago as most passengers had American issued boarding passes for the BA flight to London and BA weren't accepting those boarding passes. No explanation for the change in policy. Everyone I saw merely handed in the American boarding pass and was given a BA boarding pass. On the plane the staff were excellent - as usual. Food was good - verging on very good. Breakfast a little small but tasty. I even got a 2nd cup of tea! Journey smooth with some sleep. I stopped flying BA for 10 years because the head office is so poor - the staff on the ground are good but BA as an organisatiion comes over as badly managed: e.g. over securing client's data, telling passengers what is going on, running a decent frequent flier programme, design of the business cabin (stepping over the legs of the next passenger to go to the loo!) and so on. I only fly BA because of the lack of choice on most routes - whenever there is an alternative I try that (not American Airlines which somehow is consistently poorer than BA).\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  San Diego to Stockholm via London. Had I written this review immediately on landing it would have been zero out of ten. But I realise this would be unfair- BA is a game of two halves. The inflight experience is immeasurably improved from a few years ago. The food in Club is excellent, the cabin crew attentive and professional, the pilots are the best in the industry and IFE absolutely fine. The Club World product is competitive with the better European airlines such as Lufthansa and streets ahead of most US carriers. The problems start when anything goes wrong - which it frequently does given the mostly old fleet especially on non-core routes. In my case, the flight was cancelled due to the inbound aircraft (an ancient 747) going technical. Then a comedy of errors. First the hotel vouchers just said ‘Holiday Inn’. There are about 15 in San Diego- cue hordes of passengers looking for shuttle buses in the wrong place, arriving at hotels with no booking etc etc. Next, the replacement flights. The clunky app kept just saying error for some reason. Eventually the full website on a PC showed my replacement flights. But no booking refs or any statement if these were being offered to me, were confirmed or whatever. On calling BA they wouldn’t talk to me because I ‘failed’ security- I didn’t know the billing address of the specific booking which was done by my company’s travel department despite having a full executive club account that was associated with the booking and which they could have used. The next day I went to take the replacement flights- Alaska Airlines to Newark then SAS to Stockholm. Despite getting a boarding card and making it to my seat on the plane, I was pulled off minutes before takeoff. BA had not paid for the flight! A reservation had been created but no ticket issued. BA then booked me on a roundabout route back via Chicago plus a 12 hour layover from 4am to 4pm, getting me home over 36 hours after my original reservation. Later I spotted that the next BA flight which would get me home much sooner now had tickets available online, why was I not on this? When I called they had no explanation and only agreed to ‘exceptionally’ change my flight again after I complained about all of the above. Finally, I arrived home after a 24 hour delay and a roller coaster of incompetence. In summary, when all goes well, BA is better than it was and staff are doing a heroic inflight job. But old planes, rubbish back office IT infrastructure and plain incompetence mean this airline can be hell if anything goes wrong. And bear in mind I was travelling in business class- who knows how they treat economy passengers.\n",

My most recent experience was early January 2020 when they put me next to a couple with a newborn baby in Club World on an overnight flight from LHR to BKK. Baby screams, could not sleep and as the cabin was full, they could not move me. The couple was very nice, apologetic and we just had to bear the 12 hours long haul flight together. However, my dealings with customer service was appalling. When is BA going to offer a kids free zone in Club World for people who need to work or sleep?\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified | My partner and I spent Christmas in Tokyo. The flight over was enjoyable the staff were polite and helpful and it all ran smoothly. Our experience back home was completely different. The staff were incredibly rude and lazy. The flight was 12 hours and mid flight my partner asked for a bottle of water. The lady very rudely said she was going the other way and that my partner could head to the back and help herself. My partner headed to the back where there were two more ladies sitting and when requested they pointed to a shelf my partner got the water from. Both our TV's stopped working mid flight also for a period of 40 minutes. We asked the staff if they could fix the problem. The lady said she would try while sighing. As 25 year olds deciding on which airline brands to remain loyal to I can tell you British Airways will not be it. Terrible customer service.\n",

However, once landing in London I acknowledged that she may have the same problem flying back to Taiwan. Igot in contact with BAs' executive phone helpline service, yet spending a day speaking to them they have only caused me to speak to numerous different people all telling me to do different things. We have still not resolved the issue of her ticket not having her middle name on. BA are refusing to alter the ticket information to add my sisters middle name onto the ticket. They have not been helpful on the phone when i asked them to add her middle name and are not interested in try to solve the issue at hand. They were insistent on speaking to my sister who is from Taiwan and I told them she is unable to speak english and that i can translate any question for her.

They give you a phone number to call for these claims only to never answer the phone! They have you do a claim online only to never respond to your emails. I sent them the bank statements and credit card statement showing that I had been charged 4 times for one bag. Only 2 months later did they finally respond to the claim, claiming I had two bags and despite the fact that I sent documentation showing 4 charges and confirmed with bank and credit card that the charges had gone through, they only saw two charges and since I had two bags they didn't owe me any money. They force you to communicate via email and then don't respond they owe me $258 USD and refuse to give me my money at this point. \n",

A cabin crew member, came to my row to point out the security exit and safety card and I was listening to him and responding, despite this he ordered me to take out my cabin pressure equalizers, which he called earplugs. I explained to him that I needed to keep them on to protect my ears as the doors were already closed and I can suffer from ear problems when I fly. I told him I could hear him perfectly, as demonstrated by our vocal exchange. Despite this, he kept talking over me and threatened to remove me from my seat should I fail to follow his order. After I begrudgingly took them off, he once again ordered me to do it or be removed from my seat and I pointed out I already had! I then asked to speak to the purser, who came to see me after take off. I told him his cabin crew member was unnecessarily rude and needed Customer Care training or indeed to look for a new job. I wrote in to British Airways with my complaint, but they have not even bothered to respond. Awful, rude airline.\n",

The recently refurbished First and Club World lounge at JNB has failed to resolve the congestion when passengers from the two evening flights to LHR descend on it. There's more table space for eating and the food has improved, but poor acoustics mean intrusion on privacy. Crying babies and facetime calls add to the restless maelstrom of human activity. Boarding was reasonably quick although there was the usual confusion about group queues. The predominantly young, mixed fleet crew were competent but lacked finesse and kept on getting drinks orders muddled. The meal service took ages because of some unidentified problem with heating the main course. The food itself wasn't at all bad - when it was finally served. The cabin temperature wasn't too hot and we both slept quite well. Arrival was ten minutes ahead of schedule and baggage collection was quick. Overall, a good flight despite the aged Club World product.\n",

The flight BRU to London was fine but the transatlantic leg and Heathrow Airport Terminal 5 were utter nightmares. Never again will I go to or through Heathrow. However, this review is about BA's 747-400 to JFK an aircraft that was in such a sorry state that it should have been junked years ago. How does BA have the gall to call its service \"business class\"? The seats were tiny and wrapped in plastic chicken coop partitions that rattled and even fell down on several occasions. Let me add that we faced backwards and looked at a filthy wall. Cabin service was friendly and the food was actually quite decent. Aside from that, I now understand why BA has such a horrendous and well-deserved reputation. Never again.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  The first thing is the shortage of staff. The business cabin is quite large and eight across and seem to be serviced by one or two people each side. It meant that the drink after takeoff did not appear for an hour after the order was taken. Unfortunately although they were pleasant, the staff were not up to the mark and appeared very undertrained. I asked a young man to turn on the reading light and he claimed there weren't any. I showed him the one by my seat and after fiddling with it he said it must be broken. At the end of the flight I discovered the switch. Despite being a newly configured plane the dividing screen kept dropping. I had to ask for a cup of tea 3 times. There was only a choice of two reds and two white wines and considering the number of people in the business section I cannot understand why they  would not offer a third. There was Port on the menu but was never offered with cheese. Every time the next course came out the setting was not ready to accept it due to plates and glasses from previous course. Many people had clutter uncleared for an hour after end of meal. Most of the courses were quite small portions and by the end of the meal I was ready for a mini snack. I am not a big eater but I was peckish. The layout of the business cabin is cramped. I am 6' and I could not stretch out. The seats and legroom are extremely narrow and people in the centre two rows and the window seats have to climb over other passengers. This means no one has a easy seat. You either have to climb or be climbed over. I wonder how they can expect such a bad design to be accepted in the business market. I travel on many airlines in business and BA is still the bottom of the pile and reluctantly the last one I would use. The centre and window seats have their food and drinks served effectively through the service hatch across other customers. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Bridgetown the BA team didn't get any better. After one hour 25 minutes of waiting for my fast tracked luggage I approached a guy wearing a BA tabard and he just shrugged his shoulders. I then found another guy who worked for the ground staff and he went outside and found about 25 cases sitting by the tarmac doing nothing. \n",

Firstly they cancelled our flight a few months before departure, meaning we had to go a day earlier and pay an extra night in a hotel. The plane was old and cramped, making it difficult to get up and walk around during the 14 hour flight. The entertainment system was pathetic. Not much film choice, a random selection of tv programmes, and no games. The drinks service was lacking, my food was awful and there were no snacks offered in between.

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  London to Vancouver. I used to fly this aircraft and route for many years until it was no longer priced competitively. I flew on the 14th and it was a remarkably bad experience. Food service was very poor in most aspects. I had the chicken tandoori which was far too spicy for most palettes. No drink was offered with the meal which was astonishing. Rather, tea and coffee an obviously far cheaper offering was supplied soon after the dinner tray was handed. I had to ask twice for a beer before it was delivered.This then put me out of sync with the service. The one time (yes one time!) offer of tea and coffee was then obviously missed by me completely. Service itself was not good with no warmth or hospitality. On a 9hr flight engagement is pretty critical! Our hostess/host seemed to be only interested in those sitting in the extra legroom seats and essentially ignored everyone else. The cold snack was a cold tasteless sandwich just prior to landing. The entertainment system is a joke as it is so old. I had become so accustomed to a normal/newish TV screen that I was blown away that this system was still in place. The screen size was the equivalent of your phone’s. No music selection worth talking about so I just used my iPad. On this or similar routes I have flown Air Canada, WestJet, Virgin Atlantic, Air Transat. BA was by far the worst and some of those airlines are budget in nature and offer paid meals only. I cannot believe that the mighty BA offers such a terrible product in 2019. I will spend more to fly better and actively avoid BA on long haul.\n",

Disembarkation was delayed due to what he also described as a \"mix up\" with landing bridge allocation. So the plane had to taxi around the runway until a gate was found. We missed our connecting flight. The staff in purple at the airport who are supposed to help passengers find connecting flights didn’t know what to do. We ended up being shunted onto another flight resulting in a four hour delay. All of this inconvenience is due to BA’s incompetent management.

If you want to get anything from your bag below the seat in front of you, you will need to do some major maneuvering. Touching the person next to you throughout the flight is unavoidable. I flew on a 747 both ways. They no longer have any air vents you can adjust so both flights got stuffy and warm. I had to ask them to turn up the a/c both ways. I was literally sweating. Economy is small with the aircraft mostly made up of Business Class. Asian Vegetarian meal was good as usual although the breakfast was terrible. Asian Vegetarian breakfast in Economy Plus is much better. I will find an alternative airline for my long haul flights. It's not worth it.\n",

I immediately tried to rebook with the only other airline that flew to Jersey, but of course, they had put their air fares up for the day in question and had to pay £110 more for a return flight. I then cancelled my BA flight, but they only refunded £159 of the £187 I had paid. The £28 difference was picking my seats. How do they consider that not part of the cost of the flight? They should have refunded me everything as it was not my fault they were striking. I completed their complaint form a month ago and they have never responded to me. 2 weeks ago I phoned their Customer Service line and the person I spoke to said he would refund me the £28. I never received the refund. \n",

      "Review: Not Verified | Chicago to Zurich via London. Delays after delays. The flight was supposed to depart at 8:30 pm (Chicago Time) but was scheduled at 9:40 pm, we waited a long time at the airport. Finally, at 10 pm we managed to board on the A380 for my first time but the legroom was horrible. The IFE completely unfunctional and with no food served. During the taxi, a technical problem occurred and we returned to the gate. In the end, the plane took off at 12 am Chicago time and we arrived in London Heathrow at 2 pm. We had to wait 3 hours for boarding for another 30 minutes delayed flight. We arrived in Zurich on an old A319 at 9:30 pm Zurich time instead of the original 3:30 pm. Very stressful at least the staff were nice.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  I wouldn't even rate them 1/10 2 x business class passengers booked via On Business. 1 bag lost in transit. Ground crew in MXP rude, dismissive & most unhelpful, unable to locate missing bag. Waited for next flight to arrive, still no bag. Decided to cut short our trip as the bag contained essential meds - ok that's a lesson learnt the hard way. Due to this being an OB booking BA customer services unwilling to be flexible and change tickets resulting in full fare tickets purchased to return. Apparently the bag arrived 24hrs later, we were back in the UK, despite BA website showing in transit LHR/MXP for 8 days! Numerous lengthy calls to customer service proved fruitless, passed from one department to another then cut off! After an email to their CEO & Director of Brand and Customer Experience received a call from Global Engagement Executive Team offering £100 e-voucher. Abysmal customer services. No wonder their reputation is in tatters. I will never fly BA again.\n",

It took us 25 min to find two chairs to seat. Food was  awful and service is even worst.

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  London to Dublin. It was never my choice to fly with British Airways and I will never fly with them again. I was supposed to fly with American Airlines from the USA to Dublin, but I had a connecting flight from my origin city to Chicago. Unfortunately, my first flight was delayed due to weather, which caused me to miss the flight from Chicago to Dublin. I was put on a flight to London instead, which I had to run for when I finally made it to Chicago, and my bag did not make it on the flight. I then flew with British Airways from London to Dublin. I was told to file a lost baggage claim with BA, which I did. I was told that the bag would be transferred from American to BA when it arrived in Dublin. Using American’s baggage tracking system, I was able to confirm that the bag arrived the day after I did around noon on Saturday. I am writing this review on the following Sunday and the bag is still not in my possession. BA’s customer service is terrible. If someone there tells me one more time to just wait and be patient, I am going to lose it! My bag has been sitting at the airport in the same city I’m in for more than a day and I can’t get it. Talk about serious frustration. I don’t know which airline is at fault for the delay, but the difference is that when I called American, the rep did everything she could to find out the status of my bag. And even though their baggage claim desk was closed when I called, she still tried to call an internal number to see if anyone was still around. Unfortunately she couldn’t get hold of anyone, but she left them a message and told me exactly who I could call and when to call them the next morning. I did not receive that level of service from BA. I even asked if they could call the airport and was told, “we are not authorized to call airports.” Why in the world wouldn’t they be authorized to call their own baggage department? I am not thrilled with either airline, but at least American has made some attempt to help me. This has ruined the first three days of a trip that I planned for two years. If you do check a bag and it’s lost or delayed, don’t expect any help if you flew with BA. And here’s a tip: if you are dealing with a lost or delayed bag in a country you don’t live in, don’t call the generic customer service number on the website you would normally use. Dig around and see if you can find a number for the airport you flew into. You will get a lot more information and assistance that way. \n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to London. An email on the 25th August advising us that this flight was cancelled and the hours spent on hold never speaking to anyone, what a total awful nightmare. Then the email at 6.00pm saying I must be delighted to find out my flight has not been cancelled. All slots in the Elemis Salon were already booked so no massages were available in First Class. Arriving at HK airport on the return journey and struggling even to get from the pavement to the inside of the terminal (why did they not tell us to print out proof of travel??). We had to wait ages for BA to open a check in desk, pretty average food and service in the Qantas lounge. A broken screen in seat 59A (it would not stay in position and without wedging, unusable to constant interruptions during the flight to my partner from a large passenger climbing over him. A ghastly sweet and sour chicken main course which made me send my tray away and not eat until after leaving the flight. Cheapest goodies bag with the broken zip and my suitcase was the very last off the plane. I had already been to the BA desk and reported it when it then eventually turned up on the conveyor belt. First class out to HK was a good business class experience, the return flight in business class was in a word poor. The plane was tired, IFE faulty, poor food and the journey was only saved by the quality of the staff, they were lovely - but if you give them rubbish tools they will serve rubbish. The night term pantry offering was a total joke. I have been a BA Exec card holder since for ever and I have seen is a decline in the service level. Certainly not value for money, we did not get a Club class experience on the flight home.\n",

Evening meal served which was very ordinary but we arrived more or less on time after dodging thunderstorms near Abuja. Return flight delayed - pilot strike meant our aircraft had been parked at Lagos - and had to be flown back to Abuja with a 2 hour delay. Flight was supposed to be a 8 am departure but the airport side did not have the sense to tell us so we were herded into the gate area where there was no food facility and waited for the flight. The crew were also herded into the gate area and it was the same crew we had on the outward flight and the same plane - they had also had to have a long foodless wait but were quite chatty as we were all in the same boat. Flight totally full as flights on previous days had been cancelled. Breakfast was served but there was no evidence of the standard of meals being improved-scrambled egg was just a lump of tasteless yellow. Full credit to the crew - cheerful and efficient in spite of all the delays etc. The aircraft was clean but old and down at heel - the carpet under the seat in front was ripped and the \"floor\" was visible.\n",

      "Review: Not Verified |  Orlando to Gatwick. Travelling home was extremely disappointing. The aircraft was dirty - drink stains on the side of the cabin and the remains of chewing gum on the seatbelt. The aircraft aisle was so narrow you had to walk sideways to prevent bumping into other passengers. The aircraft had a broken toilet and lights that could not be turned off, so for a night flight part of the cabin was illuminated which made sleep difficult. The breakfast was a garlic cream cheese croissant which tasted revolting and a highly processed cereal bar. Only one drinks run was made. The standards on BA have plummeted since we last flew them seven years ago, such a shame. I hope management are looking at reviews such as this, to improve service.\n",

Seat pitch has been reduced to 30\" over the last years (from 34\") at the expense of passenger comfort. Seat width is the same as economy with empty middle seat. Food for me was half-empty plates representing a deli experience, and leaving me hungry. Out of the three options offered, two were already out of stock, so stranded with the least favourable and most unhealthy food option. Avoid Club Europe, not worth the money.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  I was supposed to fly from London City to Amsterdam on 24/7, Business Class. Once at LCY, my early pm flight appeared as cancelled. A state of confusion broke out at the airport, with people trying to find alternatives, however I managed to be rebooked on a later flight. On a busy day, I waited for hours at the airport. The new flight was displayed as “delayed” for 45mins. the delay kept on increasing, with the flight ultimately scheduled to depart after 10pm. I kept on waiting. The flight eventually ended up cancelled as well. Result: half a day wasted at LCY. I feel that BA’s punctuality and quality of customer service have been declining significantly lately. Delays and cancellations can happen, however I have been flying BA +/- 30 times a year and the % of flights delayed has been abnormally high lately, especially to/from Amsterdam and Germany. Also, the customer service seems to have a “minimum care” proposition (provide what is strictly required by the law, only if customers complain, taking as long as possible), that genuinely makes you feel worthless as a customer, whether you are a frequent flyer or not.\n",

On the day of travel, a few hours before the departure time, I realized that I would not be able to make it and so I got in touch with British Airways on Twitter advising them of my cancellation. When I arrived home, I asked them to officially cancel my ticket and issue me a refund. I understood that my ticket was a non-refundable one, but it says on the ticket that surcharges, taxes and airport fees would be refundable which should have amounted to at least 250 euro. However, all the airline  refunded me was a pitiful 50 euro. I have been trying to speak to British Airways on Twitter many times over the past few months, and they never responded positively, only insisting that they were doing the right thing and that their position would not change. British Airways is being dishonest and should be avoided.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to Copenhagen via London. The whole experience is a nightmare to me and my wife. My wife lost her luggage ever since the first day of our journey on 1st August because our two pieces of luggage were left in Heathrow Airport by BA staff when we took the transit flight from the UK to Copenhagen. We went to Menzies in CPH and they filed a repor. We stated in the missing report that if the luggage was found, they should be sent to our air b&b house in Marstal in CPH on or before 3rd August or deliver to the hotel we stayed in CPH if they were found on 4th August. On 2nd August, we found that the updated status of our missing luggage in the BA website showed that one of our luggage was found while another one had a possible match. Therefore, we kept phoning and emailing Menzies staff to urge them to send the luggage to our house but they failed to do so. And the website status showed that we chose to pick up the luggage in the airport, which was not our preference but we failed to change the preference on the website as it was preset. The system even changed the latest delivery date to 3th August 2020 instead of 2019 and we could not correct it by ourselves! On 3rd August, Menzies staff still failed to deliver the luggage to us so we told them we decided to pick them up at the airport. Unfortunately, when we went to the CPH airport on the 4th August, they told us that they had already sent the 'found' luggage to the island in Marstal on 4th. Apparently they did not follow our instructions and sent it to the wrong place on the wrong date. They then asked us to find the other luggage that had been scanned with a possible match randomly in the trolleys outside their office. We did find the other one by ourselves in the airport, which they claimed had been sent to the island but they insisted that it was the possible match one! They were so incompetent and even asked us to complain to the BA to push them to find the baggage for us. We believe that the baggage was the one which was sent to the island but is still missing but the staff messed it up. We were so confused which bag was really missing. We finally decided to ask them to deliver the luggage in Marstal to the airport and send it to the UK address which was our next destination. When we came back to the hotel in the evening on the 4th, we phoned Menzies again and found out that our luggage in Marstal had been sent back to the airport at 8 pm on the 4th. Hence, we decided to pick it up by ourselves on the 5th August before we flew to the UK. However, when we came to the airport again, we couldn't find our luggage and the staff didn't explain why and just told us to leave. If the luggage was sent it to the airport on the 4th, how come it would disappear on the 5th? The staff just kept saying that they were busy and that no one had time to look for the baggage for us. This service was totally unacceptable. We spnet hours parking at the airport and found that we got nothing! You can't imagine how furious and frustrated we were! We are literally sick of phoning Menzies staff every day and not getting anywhere. Now that Menzies staff asked us to pressure BA to in turn pressure them to locate our luggage. That's how ridiculous things have been for us. We are sure that you could do something about it. My wife has lost all her personal belongings since day 1 of our trip.\n",

We were sat on the plane for over an hour whilst the crew were waiting to hear from ground crew what was happening and where to go. Eventually got off the plane to utter chaos - mixed messages being given by ground crew. Some people given details about rebooking, others given nothing. Some people were sent texts with rebooking options, others (including me) received nothing. Vouchers handed out for hotel accommodation and shuttle bus to and from the hotels - however some people were only given one bus voucher, meaning they had no means to return to the airport the next day! Some people rebooked on a flight in two days time and told they’d have to return to the airport the next morning anyway to get any further refreshment or accommodation vouchers. Utterly appalling.

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified | A supremely awful experience from beginning to end. Flight to Vancouver delayed by 4 hours due to a plane defect that had been resolved the previous day but somehow no attempt made to make up the time in between. Only told once on board what the problem was. Delays at baggage reclaim meant I didn’t get out of Vancouver airport until after midnight (originally scheduled to arrive 6.55pm). This affected a camping trip, the booking for which could not be changed. Flight home marred by massive queues at baggage check in and on the plane, due to IT faults, none of which were communicated until we were seated on the plane and told they could not leave until passenger information could get through to the crew. Due to more IT faults the inflight entertainment was not working so nothing to watch for the 9 hour flight. Food was awful and we got a choice of one meal. Spent hours at Heathrow airport awaiting my flight home to Inverness only to be told by text one hour before departure that it was cancelled. Queued for hours to get some information from someone. They rebooked me on a flight for 26 hours later without checking this was ok - only discovered it was over a day later when I was handed my boarding pass. This means I’ve missed a trip with friends to the Edinburgh festival. Had to source my own hotel and food etc and reclaim on expenses - a lot of money coming out of my account whilst I wait for this. Now I’m seeing my rebooked flight is already delayed and was told by customer service that there’s no telling whether my bags will arrive with me - I have to wait at baggage reclaim and see! If they are not on the flight I have no information as to when I can expect to have my belongings back with me. These are merely the most significant issues, there were more and I’m really shocked at what a consistently terrible service has been provided. Between this, massive fines for data breaches and the fact that BA seem to have quite consistent and severe issues with IT, it is beyond my comprehension how they can still be in business.\n",

Usual cabin service except the staff were not the slightest bit interested in customer service and having paid a premium for business class realised it was such a waste of money.

BA can perform well on a good day, but it seems that cabin service is getting less consistent by the day - are staff preparing to go on strike as well since that is the attitude they displayed. Male cabin staff was quite offensive to some Arabic customers in front, which was a shocker.\n",

I had to ask for the menu, a bottle of water, and the meal. And after all, no apologies from the staff. Too many people are squeezed into business class. Even though I could lie down 180 degrees, I had very little space at my seat. Given the very expensive fare, I expected a much better service for business class passengers.

The flight was delayed by over three hours, whilst they ostensibly replaced the damaged aircraft with an inbound Boeing 787-9 from San Jose. The airplane was filthy dirty in Club Class, which is bad enough having to suffer the awful, dated, Club Class ying-yang facing, narrow seats with divider. Business Class on British Airways is the worst of any airline. The WIFI was out of service. On late arrival in Nashville, my luggage arrived soaking wet, and I was unable to change clothes. On my return to the UK, I contacted British Airways Customer Relations to seek compensation, and got the usual pathetic, mainly computer generated, insincere apology. I am now forced to haggle with British Airways, and endure their woeful so-called Customer Relations department. It is a real shame to witness the decline of this national carrier.

The process was ridiculously slow with each check in taking several minutes. When the priority queue representative deigned to check economy passengers, she seemed to take an eternity. In the 45 minutes it took us, the queue never dropped below about 100 people. I have never queued in a slower or more disorganised check in desk. The adjacent Jet2 desks had seven staffed desks and I counted 14 staff! The “welcome” sign displayed at the BA desk should have been located at the start of the queue with the additional wording of “you’re in for a long wait”. To cap it all, after enduring the queue, we’re now delayed 40 minutes thus far! So unprofessional!\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  Bucharest to London. My flight with British Airways was 7 hours delayed (from a European destination to London). I applied for compensation for this delay. Initially I was informed that under EU regulations I would receive 400 Euros compensation, to be informed 4 days later that this was an error and that I was no longer getting compensated. British Airways argued that sickness of a crew member is considered extraordinary circumstances (comparable with weather issues) and that therefore, they do not have to compensate passengers for this flight. However, there are court precedence cases that clearly show that crew sickness is not to be considered an extraordinary circumstance and that it is in an airlines responsibility to have a contingency strategy for such cases or compensate if they do not. I have talked to the manager of customer service and was told that there is nothing they can do as this is their policy. I believe that, if not on legal basis, British Airways should have compensated out of customer service reasons because a 7 hour delay (within Europe) is significant. Many times I picked to fly with British Airways based on the expectations of good customer service in the case of anything going wrong. But this experience proved to me that it's not worth investing that extra money into flying with British Airways.\n",

The second message was that there was no food to be served on the flight, \"we recognise that this does not meet with the standards you expect from us\". The flight was 5 hours long-so this combination of a delayed departure and no food available on board is totally unacceptable - worse than a budget airline. A midnight arrival at Heathrow was then compounded by off loading cargo before the passengers because of a \"balance problem\". In addition I was incorrectly charged Eur 75 on the return leg for my case - it was clearly the same case that I travlled out to Cyprus with but the system identified it as extra baggage. Cattle class is an under rated description of the service offered to customers. The only saving grace was the cabin crew-particularly the Customer Service Manager-who promised to follow up the baggage issue and logged my complaint.

BA website suggests passenger to arrive at the airport 3 hours before flight departure but airport check-in (the only available option) starts 2 hours before departure. No lounge available (there is a lounge in the terminal open to other airline customers, except BA). No priority boarding for Business and elite level passengers. Boarding the plane by bus. Not even free water on board in economy.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to St Lucia return. Recently returned from a two week holiday with my wife in Caribbean for a 60th birthday celebration. Tickets bought in August 2018 and decided to spoil ourselves with a Club Class return, having flown out Premium Economy. Arrived at airport to be told that we'd been downgraded to Premium Economy due to overbooking. Apologetic ground staff (defending the indefensible) but no apology on the plane. Fuming all the way back to London, exacerbated by hopeless cabin staff service (tea when I asked for coffee) and filthy food. Complained on return through BA exec Club webiste with response from Customer Service 10 days later. BA claims that overbooking is a very rare occurrence and gave a lukewarm apology. Evidence from ground staff on both journeys contradicts this and it seems to be a standard occurrence during peak season. We booked early so probably had relatively cheap seats. BA has presumably made money by selling our tickets to a higher bidder. General quality of BA service, food and wine has fallen dramatically over the last few years. BA is now effectively a low cost airline, flying a fleet of very tired aircraft, trying to preserve the gloss of a quality airline. The accountants may win in the short term but passengers will vote with their feet. Avoid this airline if you possible can. And the final insult in booking premium seats with BA is that you get charge £40 to pre reserve in Club and £70 in Premium Economy. BA, you are having a laugh with the flying public. On this performance you don't deserve to stay in business.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified | Edinburgh to Boston via London. The planes are ancient and need to be replaced. If these were cars they would have an antique plate. The seats are uncomfortable and worn. There is no lumbar support. The space between the seatback in front and your face is inches. It’s really claustrophobic. The food is awful and last evening we were not offered a choice. So for $1200 each we had horrible seats and terrible food. The short connecting flights do not even offer bottled water. The M&S menu is expensive and offers limited choices. Meal deals in the airport convenience and drug stores offer much better options for less than half the price. The planes on both long legs of the trip last week were filthy. The cabin crew on the BOS to LHR and LHR to EDI were good. There was one member in the LHR to BOS who was snippy to passengers and seemed put out by needing to do her job. Boarding is supposed to be by group but was a disaster as people queued up well before their section was called and it made it extremely difficult to get to board. British Airways has become like a budget airline who does not charge budget pricing.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Mauritius. My wife and 2 friends booked and paid £56 each to select our seats with additional legroom adjacent to the bassinet stowage. On boarding the flight the configuration of the aircraft differed, meaning we had the same seat row and number but without the additional legroom. My formal complaint to BA has been met with what can only be described as condescending platitudes and a blank refusal to refund our seat booking fee. We feel that this a scam and are continuing to pursue the matter. Trading standards are also being informed. It didn’t help the aircraft was delayed by 4 hours on the outward leg, was filthy dirty. The return flight had numerous IFE defects and my seat recline did not work. I also noted a number of cabin minor airworthiness issues, (I am a licensed engineer). A marketing email in celebration of 100 years of service has thanked me for flying hundreds of thousands of miles with BA and then rips me off with nothing in return. British Airways you are a disgrace, get your act together and provide the service you were once famed for.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  Horrible flight BA from Gatwick to Cape Town and Iberia on the return. I am only 5'2\" 8st 10 and I find the leg room too cramp. The onboard flight entertainment system was down on the BA flight most of the time. It was probably in the last 2 hours of the flight before they managed to fix it and the system was old fashioned and movies were streamed on a loop. The food was barely edible. Coming back on Iberia the entertainment system was better and the food was also better but the seats legroom was just as bad. I was almost bumped off my connecting flight at MAD due to the lockers being filled up. I had another connection to make at LHR and I was not going to miss that so I had to insist they let me on though loads of other passengers were led off. This was the worst flight I have flown on. Last long haul BA flight for me.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  New York to Venice via London. Staff have been nice when around but aircraft, food, assistance and information all deplorable. Booked Business class. First flight, overnight from JFK to Heathrow - quick, mediocre food service then gone. Chair is set up so I’m staring at a stranger, it’s uncomfortable and difficult to maneuver with no instructions. Didn’t wake me for breakfast, not sure why they had me fill in a form for when I wanted to be woken up. No instructions for the transition between BA flights. Now I’m on the flight from Heathrow to Venice, no offer of coffee, water but worse, business class is just coach class, no extra leg room, just 3 seats with the middle one blocked out. Person in front of me put their seat back and my knees are in my chest. I didn’t pay for international business class to get stuck in uncomfortable seats for 2 long flights. I won’t fly BA again. \n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to London Heathrow. Club Class on British Airways is without doubt the worst in the airline industry.  It is bad enough that BA persist using out of date airplanes, circa 25 year old B747-400's, but they perpetuate the dreadful ying/yang seating arrangement of Club Class, where you have to look directly at the passenger next to you, and raise a screen for privacy. Then, mid-flight the crew lower the screen to serve the food. To leave the seat, one has to climb over the legs of a sleeping passenger;~no mean feat in the dark. The crew from Chicago were appalling, and dumped the food upon us as quickly as possible. Breakfast was inedible, and I returned it uneaten. The lounge at O'Hare was a crowded, tiny, dirty facility, with a food bar including some wilted vegetables and crackers with cheese. Insufficient chairs, and a single, old TV. Does no one at BA care how BAD they have become for premium class passengers.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  London to Chicago. Could it get any worse? The flight to Chicago was equipped with the usual ancient Boeing 747-400. The British Airways First Class product doesn't come up to modern Business Class standards. This particular flight was late again, and the food / wine was simply awful. There is nothing remotely elegant about BA First Class, and the crew demonstrate no sophistication. This experience was like dining at your worst restaurant chain. Finally, not only is the aircraft tired and worn out, but the in flight so-called entertainment system did not work, and had to be rebooted twice. The First Class seat is a bad joke, and extraordinarily uncomfortable. British Airways are at least twenty years out of date with their entire First Class product. All that can be said about this airline is woeful. The Concorde First Class lounge at Heathrow is filthy dirty, and desperately needs refurbishment.\n",

Some reviews say that the last few windows are blanked off at rear of the aircraft but not so on this plane. Breakfast was served which was OK. Cabin crew mixed, mostly young and worked quickly. Crew uniform still looks a bit tatty compared with rivals in this part of the world. There is good and bad still with BA - bad was the so called chicken wrap served just before arrival - leathery and inedible - why do they let themselves down with such a poor offering - hardly any passengers near me could eat it. Bad was that there was an old tissue and food wrapper in my seat pocket. Good was the newer aircraft and the breakfast has improved. Arrived on time at Heathrow but to a remote stand.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified | San Diego to London. From the moment that I boarded this flight (due to take off at 19.25), the crew had one interest and one only - to get the cabin lights off, which they duly achieved two hours later. As a consequence, the service was negligent in the extreme. This was a Club World ticket - so expensive and I looked forward to a decent level of service. However, I wasn't offered champagne on boarding, wine with my meal or coffee and port after my meal. I complained to BA when I got home but they weren't interested and I was met with a barrage of corporate platitudes. This flight was a disappointing end to what had been a great trip to the US & Mexico and has left me with a very poor view of the airline.\n",

      "Review: Not Verified |  London to Tampa. BA broke my suitcase and I did not make a fuss, I just got a new one. The new one was too large for the overhead bin on the return flight (the only suitcase I could purchase while abroad). So on top of the new suitcase, I had to actually pay BA to check the new bag. Cost me over $100 for their mistake. They also shovel off customer service to some company abroad. You will get an email a month later saying \"I'd like to know you that we are unable to offer refund\". Make a big fuss at the airport if they break your stuff so that you can avoid this black hole they call customer service.\r\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  My husband and I flew on British Airways flight BA-228 from Baltimore to London Heathrow leaving on the 12th February 2019. Every aspect of the flight was poorer than what budget airlines have to offer. The plane was shabby and dated. The seat reclining facility did not operate properly, was not that comfortable, and we had less legroom than the equivalent with budget airlines. The touch screen TV monitor was not working properly. One ear bud on the headphones did not work. The audio socket was too loose for the headphones so the plug kept falling out making it difficult to enjoy the in-flight entertainment (which in itself had a dated choice). The pillow was disgusting and kept falling out of the flimsy cover. The air conditioning lacked consistency alternating between very hot and very cold air. The restroom occupied sign always lit up as vacant even if it was occupied. However what made the flight very unpleasant was the bad attitude of the cabin crew. They were abrupt, unfriendly and quite clearly did not want to be there. There was one exception, an extremely pleasant older crew member who greeted us on and off the flight. There did not appear to be any organisation or smooth co-ordination when distributing the meals. Our two trays of food where placed on top of each other and practically thrown at us by a sour faced crew member. This flight was one hour late making us nervous about catching our connecting flight. There was no information or instructions given to us about connecting flight gate numbers before we landed. Unlike all the other airlines that I have travelled with there were no staff member greeting the connecting customers to point them in the right direction or re-assure them. British Airways would be my last choice of an airline to travel with and I would only fly with them again if there was no other option.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  Bridgetown to Gatwick. I couldn't imagine that first class on BA would be the same as travelling in business class with for example Qatar, Emirates, Etihad, Singapore, Thai etc for double the price. Cabin, seats and food equals business class. One of the red wines on the wine list was out from start when I left London outbound. Cabin crew worked well and gave splendid service. But first class on BA is not worth the fare. When I complained to customer service after I got home, all I got was they are in the process of upgrading world traveller. \n",

Problems in December 2018 at Heathrow check-in when BA check-in and baggage management IT systems went down for at least 90 minutes. Total chaos with people like myself arrived at the airport 2:30 hours before the flight and queuing while others arriving 45 minutes prior to their departure and given priority. Even though we were checked in at some point, the flight was delayed by 2+ hours on top of the problems. Then flight does not have enough food onboard. At least the crew clearly attempted to reduce flight time to the minimum.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  I booked a British Airways flight from Amsterdam to London Heathrow. In the beginning everything went normal and smooth. Check-in and boarding was easy and on time and once everyone boarded the problems started one after another. First an announcement was made by the pilot about a flight delay due to strong winds in Heathrow (fair enough). Afterwards the wind problem was resolved but a passenger decided to leave so they had to take out his luggage. After that we received a 3rd announcement stating there is a computer malfunction at Schiphol Airport and they are doing their best to resolve it. This caused us already about 45-60 mins delay but me and other passenger still remained calm and relaxed and then the hell started. We received permission to take off after 7 mins and then the pilot offered passengers who do not wish to travel to leave the plane. Of course there were many passengers who were travelling on business and I guess too delayed to make it on time for their meetings so they decided to leave. The crew warned them that this might cause terrible delay and problems for the other passengers but they still decided to leave. So a group of passengers left and we missed our opportunity to take off. Then the pilot announced that we can take off after 2,5 or 3 hours. The flight was full of overseas travellers. We spent 2 hours sitting in a plane which was not moving anywhere, people unboarded the plane 4 times in total and no food or water was offered to us. We had to line up next to the bathroom to purchase food and drinks and pay for it. The overall experience was terrible and it ruined the whole plan for my first day in London.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified |  Antigua to Gatwick. Apparently it is necessary to pay extra to get a decent seat by priority booking despite having paid the full cost of world traveler plus. We checked in as soon as the online check in was available to find that only 4 seats (for the 4 of us) remained unbooked. We had to take 2 seats on the front row where the seats had no under seat storage and were as narrow as the economy seats, and 2 on the back row where we were constantly bothered by the adjacent toilets. Only 1 loo each side between the economy and economy plus meant that there were always queues of people leaning against us. Cabin pressure was uncomfortably low, overnight temperature was stifling hot and few people got any sleep at all. Breakfast was a hard cold half sandwich with a hurried cup of tea or coffee. Impossible to get any drinks or refreshments between the service rounds. Tatty seat covers, broken foot rest, malfunctioning entertainment, broken tables requiring us to hold our food and drink between our knees. When asked for help the stewardess told us she didn't have a screw driver to fix these things and it was an old plane with lots of this type of issue.\n",

      "Review: ✅ Trip Verified | I understand completely why there is air rage in the skies when companies such as BOAC go out of their way to make the travel experience an stressful and unpleasant as is humanly possible. I paid $813 to fly r/t LAX-BUH and yet they want an extra $150 to have a desirable seat. I understand if you check-in 24 hours before departure you receive a seat from those available, but why is it they assign you the worst seat available when betters are there? In my case, they assigned me a middle seat on a 787 when both of the adjacent aisle seats are available to assign. It is baffling. The ground crew and the inflight staff are excellent but can do little with the oppressive business decisions their executives make - everything comes down to make every penny they can. And why am I flying BOAC? They owed me £25 from the last flight b/c the inflight entertainment system was inop for 1/2 the cabin and so we all had to sit in the dark with nothing to do for a twelve-hour flight. On top of that, their seats have so little padding and cushion that only the plumpest can sit in their seats longer that 15\". For normal-sized adults, it is as agonising as the rack must've been. And of course you only get compensation by patronising them again. Now I know: ever a free ticket on BOAC is overpriced.\n",

Ground experience not great - at LHR automated bag drop didn't work and it wasn't clear why; slow-to-react assistance eventually came and identified travel visa to India needed to be validated. At BLR, no online check-in available and slow process. Plane decor extremely run down and shabby, various pieces of the interior trim (bulkheads etc) rattling  and latches for bassinet shelves not locking. Row 12 so bulkhead seat and legroom excellent, however this comes with the hassle of not being able to leave anything on the floor for takeoff and landing; the stowage racks are never big enough to hold the blanket and pillow provided. Seat itself could have more width (I kept bumping the VOD control and I'm quite slim), recline limited and footrest could extend more. No USB power in seat which seems crazy in this day and age. VOD itself is atrocious; tiny screen (folding out of armrest on bulkhead seats), low resolution, visible gridlines and very little choice (hardly the latest movies). To top it off, on outbound leg the VOD stopped working altogether and resisted many resets. Customer service forms were handed out so I await the outcome of that. Food volume OK, quality poor (scrambled eggs in breakfast smelled terrible!), plenty of drinks on outbound leg but not inbound, cabin staff seemed indifferent on inbound leg. Insufficient lavatories for Premium Economy and Economy.\n",
